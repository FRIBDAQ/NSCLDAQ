#   Pipeline to connect to a ring buffer and write event files for the next run in 
#   NSCLDAQ 8.2 format (that is fixed length buffer format).
#
#  Usage:
#    eventlog url
#
#  Note that if the  BUFFERSIZE environment variable is set and is numeric it
#  sets the blocking factor for the output file.
#
#  Event files are written to the cwd.

#  Establish the location of the installed binaries.
