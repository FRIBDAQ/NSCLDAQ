      - Fix error in CRingItem copy construction ... if there was a
	payload, the m_pCursor member was not being set to point to the
	end of that payload...leading the CRingItem target to think the
	item was empty.  This was also a problem with operator= which also
	used CRingItem::copyin where the problem lay.
      - Fix various copy in issues with CRingBuffer and subclasses.
	make all the tests pass that should pass and remove those that
	should no longer pass due to changes in the way sampling
	has been done.
