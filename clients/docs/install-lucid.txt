Installation instructions for NSCLDAQ on ubuntu lucid lynx (10.10).


These instructions assume that you can, and have:
1. Installed lucid on your target system.
2. Have the following tarballs from sourceforge.net's nscldaq project.
   spectrodaq-pregt-1.68g.tar.gz
   nscldaq-8.2-016.tar.gz

These instructions are specific to Ubuntu, however with some familiarity with
package names on other distributions you ought to be able to extrapolate how to
do installations there too.

I. Unwrapping the tarballs.

Put the spectrodaq and nscldaq tarballs in /usr/src

tar xzf spectrodaq-pregt-1.68g.tar.gz
tar xzf nscldaq-8.2-016.tar.gz


II. Installing the dependent software

NSCLDAQ depends on some packages that are not installed by default.
These must be installed first prior to installing the rest of the system:

cd nscldaq-8.2-016/docs
. packages.lucid

you will be prompted a few times  about whether or not you want to install
additional packages.  Answer Y to each prompt, or hit <Enter> as Y is the
default.


Once this has completed you will need to create a configured kernel source tree
so that the nscldaq configuration/build procedure can build the SBS driver
properly: 

cd /usr/src
tar xjf linux-source*.tar.bz

The actuall name of the linux source tarball will depend on when you install
ubuntu lynx. we will call it a.b.c-d-generic (uname -r will return the versino
string). 

cd linux-source-`uname -r`
cp /boot/config-`uname -r` .config
make-kpkg configure
make-kpkg binary

You must wait for this process to complete before installing nsclaq (step IV).
You can install spectrodaq in parallel with the kernel build, however
(step III below).

III Installing spectrodaq


spectrodaq is the data distribution engine for NSCLDAQ 9.x and earlier (no
there isn't a 9.x yet that version is reserved for the last nscldaq revision to
use spectrodaq version 10.0 [which is testing] uses an entirely different data
distribution system).

cd /usr/src/spectrodaq-pregt
./configure --prefix=/usr/opt/spectrodaq
make depend install


IV  Installing nscldaq

cd /usr/src/nscldaq-8.2-016
./configure --prefix=/usr/opt/daq/8.2 \
	    --with-kernel-sources=/usr/src/linux-sourcce-`uname-r`
make install

VI  System startup files

A.  Appendix A Installing the VM-USB readout framework.

B.  Appendix B Installing the CC-USB readout framework.
