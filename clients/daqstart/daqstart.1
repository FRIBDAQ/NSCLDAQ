.TH daqstart 1 "July 2004" daqstart-1.0 "USER COMMANDS"

.SH NAME
daqstart \- start a program with stdout/stderr logging and exit notification

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B daqstart [OPTIONS]... command words...
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This utility facilitates the collection of logging/debugging information from
programs that were not originally intended to produce logs.  daqstart runs a
target program.  Stdout and stderr of the target program are initialized as
pipes that are monitored by the daqstart program.  Output on each pipe is
collected a line at a time and relayed to daqstarts stdout or stderr as
appropriate.  If a logging sink has been attached to the standard file, lines
are timestamped and logged to that sink as well.  This utility is also very
useful for programs that are run from desktop shortcuts under window managers
such as e.g. kde.
.PP
On target program exit, if an error sink is specified, an exit message is
logged to the error sink.  The exit message contains such information about why
the program exited as UNIX can provide (exit status and signal), and is also
timestamped.   
.PP
If the \-\-notify option is specified, the exit message is also sent to
daqstart's stderr. Additionally, if the DISPLAY environment variable is defined
and the PopUp program is executable in the current path, it is invoked to pop
up an Xwindows dialog with similar information.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP 
\-h \-\-help
Display short help and exit.
.TP
\-V \-\-version
Print program version number and exit.
.TP
\-eSink \-\-error=Sink
Specify a logging sink for the program's standard error output.  
If specified, lines sent by the program to stderr are timestamped 
and teed to this
sink as well.  See SINK SPECIFICATIONS for more information about
specifying sinks.
.TP
\-oSink \-\-output=Sink
Specify a logging sink for the program's standard output output.  
If specified, lines sent by the program to stdout are 
timestamped and teed to this
sink as well.  See SINK SPECIFICATIONS for more information about
specifying sinks.
.TP
\-n \-\-notify
Enables exit notification for the command.  If specified, the user is
notified of command exit.  Commend exit is always logged to the error
sink.  \-\-notify causes an message to be sent to stderr that includes the
command name, the exit status and, if exit was due to an uncaught signal, the
signal that caused the process to exit.  If the environment variable DISPLAY is
defined and the program PopUp is in the path, it is run to produce an X11 pop
up message as well.

.SH SINK SPECFICATIONS
   A sink is specified by a string containing two fields separated by a colon:
sinktype:sinkname
The left field is the sink type, while the right field is a sink name
interpreted within the sink type.  For example, the sink specification:
file:/user/fox/output.log specifies the sink is a file, and that the file is
/user/fox/output.log. 
.PP
Sink types that are currently supporteed include:
.TP
file
A file.  The sink name is the name of the file.
.PP
If all this seems like a bit much to specify a file, recall that this is
version 1.0 of the program and future versions will probably support other sink
types.

.SH EXAMPLES
.TP
Log stderr for ls

.nf
daqstart --error=file:$HOME/error.log  ls
.fi

The ls command is started with its stderr logged to $HOME/error.log.  stderr
output will also be visible on the controlling terminal.
.TP Log stdout and stderr as well as notify on exit for ReadoutShell.tcl

.nf
daqstart --error=file:$HOME/error.log   \\
         --output=file:$HOME/output.log \\
         --notify /usr/opt/daq/Scripts/ReadoutShell.tcl spdaq20 \\
                  $HOME/bin/RunReadout daq1ide
.fi
.PP
Runs the ReadoutShell script.  If ReadoutShell exits, the user will be notified
via an stderr message and a pop-up window on the X11 display.  All output from
ReadoutShell.tcl will be timestamped and logged to $HOME/output.log  All error
messages from ReadoutShell.tcl will be timestamped and logged to
$HOME/error.log 
.SH BUGS
This program can only effectively monitor line oriented output.
