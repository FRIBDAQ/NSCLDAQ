Description:

Logs the associated message to the file.

- FormatLine is called to produce the line to write to the file
- The log file is written with the line.
- Output buffers are flushed so that the log file is immediately updated.

Parameters:

\param Message (const string & [in]
   The line that is to be written to file.  The line will already have a \n to terminate it.




\return int
\retval  >0 The number of characters written to the file.
\retval <=0 Is an error condition.
