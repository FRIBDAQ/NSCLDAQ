This directory contains unit tests for the redesign of the scripted readout 
to support:

- packet module
- configuration of packetization on readout command.
- While the Makefile is generated from Makefile.am, these tests are not
  built by the product installation.  Run the tests as follows:

o At top level of the system (if you want the device drivers installed,
  do this as root):
   ./configure --prefix=<installation-directory>
   make
   make -k install

o cd contrib/scriptedReadout
  make clean                  # Get rid of any old objects I forgot about.
  make                        # build the test code requires cppunit.
  make test		      # run the tests.
