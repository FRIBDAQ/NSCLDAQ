7.1-005 3/31/03
    -  Allow Readout/Active.cpp Active::EndRun to be harmlessly called
       when the run is not in progress.

7.1-002-004 - 
	Fixed misc. problems with Stager and with ReadoutGui
        to make these more production quality.

7.1-001  2/11/03: 
  - ./configure.in  - Fix an error in the search for the SBS/Bit3 headers.
    the script would fail if the initial set of directories did not contain
    the headers...even if the secondary search set did.
  - VMEApi/Makefile.am
    VMEApi/SBSBIT3API.h  - this file was mis-named and should have been called
	SBSBit3API.h  (note difference in capitalization).  The file has been
        renamed and Makefile.am fixed up to produce an appropriate tarball.
  - Stager/directories.tcl - Modified to support a BUFFERSIZE environment
	variable that can be used to modify the behavior of 
	ExpFileSystem::GenRunFile in the event the user has overidden the 
	default daq buffersize

7.1-002 3/2/03:
-   Correct the name of the Vme API library.
-   No longer set the busy when scalers are being read as that can
    cause false triggers in the case where the user is using the busy
    as the trigger signal.

7.1-003 3/17/03
	ReadoutGUI defect fix:  If a link to the event file already exists 
	in the ~/experiment/current directory at the start of a recorded run, 
	the run start fails.  Fixed by removing such links if required.

	ReadoutGUI defect fix:  If readout is being recompiled as it runs, 
	ReadoutGUI can hang or readout can die.  Fixed by copying readout 
	program to 'private hidden' directory first.

	Added production readout software to the autoconf build, along with 
	its documentation.

7.1-004 3/23/03
	This release adds the SBS/Bit3 device driver to the build.  
	 SBS/Bit3 has kindly released the source code of this driver for 
	open distribution so long as redistribution includes acknowledgement 
	of the SBS Technologies copyright.

	From now on, it will be necessary to be root to build the system 
	in order to get the device driver properly installed.

	Changes:
	- Minor bug fixes.
	- SBS/Bit3 device driver included in the build.

7.1-005 3/31/03
    -  Allow Readout/Active.cpp Active::EndRun to be harmlessly called
       when the run is not in progress.

7.2    ??/??/??
    - Support multi-crate configurations of the CAENCard and CAENChain
      modules.
    - Support for the CAEN V890 multihit tdc.
    - Many stager bugs fixed.  to alloow multiple hits

7.2.2 12/05/03
   - Abstracting the device support libraries from the Readout software.

7.2.2-001 12/05/03
   - Stager: At install time create a package InstallRoot that allows
     us to figure out where we're installed (needed to reliably locate
     eventlog e.g.).

7.3    12/05/03
    - Incorporate the CAEN V812 CFD GUI developed by Ron Fox,
      Mike Famiano, and Anton Zalessov:
       $(prefix)/contrib/caenv812.
    - Incorporate scripted readout engine developed initially for
      LLNL, LBL then SEE and RPI by Ron Fox.
    - Added bunches of stuff to the contrib directory for scriptable readout.


7.3-005 3/3/04
    - Did a merge with the 7.4 branch for:
       framework
       controlpush ...
       ProductionReadout
       configure.in
       Makefile.am
     in order to get the controlpush functionality and readout fixes that
     go along with it.
    - Fix incorrect base address for vme trigger/status module was
      0xf000 sb. 0x444400
7.3-006 3/10/04
   - Merge production readout with 7.4 branch to incorporate fix for
     issue 116: Title, run variable and state variable values that are too
     large cause all sorts of grief.
7.3-007 3/24/04
   - Merge Scaler client from 7.4 to catch a long standing issue I'd
     forgotton about: Update needs to be called even if there are no
     scalers (if only to keep track of run time).
   - Merge Production readout with 7.4 branch to incorporate fix for
     issue 106: Elapsed run time incorrect.
7.3-008 3/31/04
   - Merge in the fixes to the Stager/ReadoutGui that constitute the fix
     for issue 108: Event files can be ovewritten with no prompt.
   - Merge in fix for production readout - stabilization of scaler readout timings.
7.3-008 4/12/04
   - Added build stamp to the installation procedure
   - Fixed an incompatibility with tcl 8.4 and cratelocator.tcl
   - Fixed controlpush - plc channels need extra time to connect
   - Added # escaping to controlpush and to production readout
7.3-009 4/18/04
   - Modify Stager so that it can record tape on a different node than
     it records ftp data.
   - Issue 112: Warn the user if the scaler client is started with the default
     data source.  At the NSCL this is an unusual occurence.  Note that
     the warning will be sent via an Xwindows window if possible or if not
     via stderr.
7.3-010 
   - Modify VMEPtr.cpp - was ignoring the crate number.!!!
   - TCLList.cpp - needs to use Tcl_Free not free() for TCL 8.4 and higher.
   - DiskRun - Had an error with strlen that clobbered stack occaisonally.
   - Recover lost version of sis3300 software.
   - Add -p to untar that creates ~/experiment/runx directories..
     otherwise the file permissions are governed by umask.

7.3-011
   - Fix defect 139 - non numerics in readoutgui run number field cause
     failure in status line; added validator to prevent run number field
     from becoming non-numeric.
7.3-012
   - Allow caennet controllers to live in any VME crate (caennet.tcl).
   - Fix defect 143 - last scaler has incorrect value from sclclient.
7.3-014
   - Fix defect in production readout. was not calling scaler initializtions.
7.3-015
   - Fix defect in vmetcl build - was linking vmelibs from install dir
     rather than build dirs.
   - Increase controlpush connection timeouts, had some intermittent
     connection failures.
7.3-016
   - ProductionReadout/CReadoutMain.cpp must define main() if spectrodaq_main()
     is defined, otherwise, TCL++'s main get's pulled in first since
     main was separated into a different module of spectrodaq.

7.3-017
   - Ensure that -lbtp is prior to spectrodaq ld flags so that we don't
     have any undefs from pthread.
   - Need to fix some ExprLong's that should be strtol's to work with
     TCL-8.4 where ExprLong limits at signed longs.
   - Fix long standing uncaught typo in Readout/Reader.cpp where the
     m_pTrigger member was used where m_pBusy was intended at init.
   - Fix typos in goShaper{16} and document need to run in spdaq system.
7.3-018
February 23, 2005  Fix inconsistent timestamp treatments of tm_month: 
	January will now be month 1 everywhere.
7-3-019
January 2, 2006 - Make this work with newer versions of auto tools

7.3-020
January 17, 2006 Fix error in declaraion of CCAMACScalerLRS2551::Read

  Release September 21, 2006
7.3-022
  November 9, 2006 - Install the CHANGELOG 
  November 17, 2006 - Fix defect 231 by failing the
    configure if gdbm.h or libgdbm are missing, rather than
    generating broken Makefiles that will fail later on.
  November 22, 2006 - fix defect 233 - CCAMACScalerLRS4434 was not
     correctly reading.

Released January 15, 2007

7.3-023 
  Week of March 5, 2007:
      Remove write access from event files after finalization.
  Week of March 12, 2007:
      Only allow write access to stagearea/complete when changing its contents.
  Week of April 2, 2007:
       Fix som eissues in the skeleton Makefiles ..where
       gcc and g++ are used, rather than the actual compiler commands
       at config time.
  Week of April 9, 2007
       Fix issues in scripted makefiles where again gcc/g++ were used rather than
       $(CC) $(CXX)
  Week of April 23, 2007
       Ensure that framework's Makefile installs the implementations of
       template classes so that compilation against template
       class headers (which include the implementations) will not fail.
 7.3-024
  Week of April 30, 2007
       - add -f to all the mv commands in Experiment.tcl so that they don't
         try to prompt for y/n if they are replacing a write protected file.. 
         as I assume I know what I'm doing.
       - Remove extraneous t from file join that constructs the final resting
         place of event files. This probably crept in when I did the
         permissions stuff.
