7.4:

- Added program controlpush to push EPICS controls data into tcl server
  programs (e.g. ProductionReadout too).
- Fixed several issues with Production Reaodut's tcl server:
  o Added tcl command error reporting.
  o Correctly handled the case where multiple lines are available on the
    socket.
- ProductionReadout - quote and escape the contents of runvariables and
  statevariables so that arbitrary characters like [ can appear in the
  variable values.
- Framework CSocket::Bind - prior to bind(), enable 
   SO_REUSEADDR to deal with lingering sockets if e.g. readout exits and then
   restarts soon.
- Fix incorrect base address of VME trigger/status module was 0xf000 s.b.
  0x444400 (production readout)
- Fix issue 076: Elapsed time from readout classic is not correct.
- Fix issue 116: Titles, runvars and statevars that don't fit can cause
  a great deal of grief.
- Fix issue 106: Elapsed time from runs is not correct for production rdo.
- Added -rpath on Makefiles for scripted readout and scaler server so user
  does not need to worry about the location of shared libs. Stabilized
  the actual timer trigger so that the latency is unimportant.
- Fix issue 108: Event data files can be overwritten without any prompts.
                 Added to this fix for disabled entry widget poor contrast.
- Put -rpaths in all the Makefiles so we don't need LD_LIBRARY_PATH
  and we always get the right directory.
- Use includes in skeleton makefiles to try to isolate stuff we might modify
  from stuff the user might modify.
- Add a build stamp to the installation procedure.
- Fix incompatibility (bug 121) with Tcl 8.4 for cratelocator.tcl
- Allow plc channels longer to connect in controlpush, and the heck
  with looking for units for them.
- In both controlpush and production readout, add # to the set of 
  characters escaped when writing TCL scripts.
- Added dvdburn product shamelessly stolen from what I did for SEE.
- Support writing tape on a different host than ftp'd to.
- Add design by contract headers (Headers/DesignByContract.h).
  In readout software catch DesignByContractException s that may be thrown
  as a result of user code.
- Issue 112: If sclclient is started with a local data source. Warn using
  X11 if possible or stderr if not.
- VMEPtr.cpp -was ignoring the crate parameter.
- For TCL 8.4 and later it's not so safe to call free(), for stuff
  that came from Tcl_SplitList, better to call Tcl_Free, otherwise I have
  seen segfaults.
- Fix some doxygen errors in Framework.
- CIntConfigParam.cpp - suport unsigned 32 bits as well as signed.
- CCAENModule.cpp - make "waitloops" for data ready adjustable.
- Fix DiskRun stack clobber problem.
- Add -p to tar in Experiment.tcl that creates the ~/experiment/runn dirs.
  otherwise user's umask can modify the output permissions.
- Issue 115: do non-blocked writes to spectcldaq's output pipe, and \
  analyze the returns thoroughly to try to remove the occaisional hung
  spectcldaq process.
- Issue 109 Provide mechanism to hide ReadoutShell's parameters.
- Added support for CAENV1190/1290 TDC module.
  o Correct the bad info about the leading/trailing edge detect Carlo gave me.
- Repair defect 138: Scripted Readout leaks file descriptors.  I had
  had problems getting rid of the old configuration at begin of run and
  had decided to live with the memory leak, but it turns out that also
  leaks file descriptors as module objects stay around and those run out
  first.
- Repair defect 139 - Non numerics in run number cause status line of
  readout gui to blow up.
- Added daqstart program... support starting a program with logging and
  exit notification.
Week of July 26, 2004:
- Added man page for daqstart -> $prefix/man/man1.
- Added daqman command to retrieve daq man-pages.
- Support caennet controllers in any crate number.
Week of August 2, 2004:
- Added support for CES8210's in crates other than 0 for camac.tcl.
Week of August 9, 2004
- Added support for Wiener VC/CC32 camac controllers in multiple
  VME crates to tcl support.  This completes the fix for
  Enhancement request BZ 136 (http://daqbugs.nscl.msu.edu/show_bug.cgi?id=136).
Week of August 16, 2004
- Put CopyIn support back into CAENcard.cpp to improve
  performance for e.g. scripted readout.  NOTE: Users
  must have Spectrodaq 0.8.1-001 at the earliest as prior
  versions of Spectrodaq have CopyIn broken or missing.
  (Missing is not so bad as conditional compilations will
   fall back to word by word copy... broken is bad since
   it segfaults).
- Bring scaler display software into mainline part of distribution.
- Add man page for sclclient.
- Add man page for bufdump.
- Add man page for tclserver
- Fix defect 140: Support multiple VME crates for shaper GUI:  
  Also did a whole bunch of common code factorization out into shaperapp.tcl.
  the GUI's are now only shadows of their former selves, and shaperapp16.tcl
  is as well
Week of August 30
- Added eventlog manpage.
- Added log of run start time in ascii end of run report for ScalerDisplay
- Import vhqpanel from see and make it multicrate clean.
Week of Sept. 6
- Added man page for Vme TCL loadable package.
- Added man page for caennet TCL loadable package.
- Added man page for vhq TCL loadable package.
Week of Sept. 20
- Fix defect in Production readout: CExperiment never invokes the scaler
  initialization function.
- Add manpage for camac package (CES 8210).
Week of Sept. 27
- Fix defect in build: vmetcl was linking btp e.g. from the install dirs
  rather than the build dirs causing errors for make (not make install) on
  systems that had never been installed on before.
- Increase connection timeouts of controlpush. some were intermittently not
  connecting.
Week of October 25, 2004
- Add TCL_STUBFLAGS make variable that is the link flags to link a tcl extension
  against the tcl stub library.
- Link the vme access extension against the stub lib to make it starkit compatible.
- Allow a find on static tcl libs without requiring dynamic libs.

Week of November 1:
   Create branch to maintain DAQ 7.4 version.
---- Fixes:

7.4-001 : 
    - Add RangeError.h to Exception... required by build.
    - Autodetect existence of spectrodaq_main() and supply a main()
      in production readout if there else TCL++'s main confuses stuff.

7.4-002 :
     - Ensure that scripted readout supplies a main too if HAVE_SPECTRODAQ_MAIN
       is defined.
     - Some ExprLongs in the contrib software still need to be switched over to 
       strtoll's.
     - Fix typo in Readout/Reader.cpp - where m_pTrigger is used where
       m_pBusy was intended.
     - In the readout makefiles comment about how to select between the
       CAMAC controllers.
     - Fix typo on n568panel makefile
     - Correct documentation in skeleton Makefiles; to get the Wiener
       VC32 interface, use -DVC32CAMAC not -DWIENERCAMAC
     - Correct mis-spelled macro name is Production readout skeleton Makefile
       clean target.
     - Fix some typos in contrib/N568Panel goShaper goShaper16 as well as
       document the need to run this in an spdaq system.
     - Make all the sample .cfd files valid.
7.4-003
     - Fix timestamp inconsistencies with month numbering that are scattered
	all over the place.
     - Scripted readout- conditionalize main on HAVE_SPECTRODAQ_MAIN
     - Delay spectcldaq with usleep a short time between write tries if blocked.7.4-004
     - Backport use of absolute times in ReadoutGui to 7.4 from 8.0
     - Use cerr for ftp errors in eventlog because ftp lib does not set
       errno to a useful value.
