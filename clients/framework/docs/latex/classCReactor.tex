\subsection{Detailed Description}
Encapsulates the base class for reactors. A reactor is an object which responds to an  event. This class hierarchy is of necessity slightly parallel to the Monitor hierarchy. In additional to the Named Object standard functions, all monitors must implement:\begin{CompactItemize}
\item 
operator() - called when the monitor fires.\end{CompactItemize}
\begin{CompactItemize}
\item 
{\bf On\-Event}() {\rm (p.\,\pageref{classCReactor_a6})} - Called from operator() if an event fired.\item 
{\bf On\-Error}() {\rm (p.\,\pageref{classCReactor_a7})} - Called from operator() if a monitor detected and error.\item 
{\bf On\-Timeout}() {\rm (p.\,\pageref{classCReactor_a8})}- Called from operator() if a monitor deteted a timeout.\end{CompactItemize}
As a named object, CReactor's require a name on construction. The name is entered into the \char`\"{}Reactor\char`\"{} registry. As a convenience, a default  constructor is supplied, however. If used the default constructor generates a name of the form Reactor\_\-nnn where nnn is a unique number... from m\_\-Auto\-Index.

This base class provides: Get\-Auto\-Name member function for derived classes which desire to implement this functionality as well.

Default constructor. A Reactor with name of the form Reactor\_\-nnn is created. The reactor is entered in to the \char`\"{}Reactor\char`\"{} registry of the  classified object registry returned from get\-CClassified\-Object\-Registry(). The name used is gaurenteed unique and can be queried via: {\bf get\-Name}() {\rm (p.\,\pageref{classCNamedObject_a6})}.

Operation Type: Interface Definition

Purpose:

This method is called in response ot an event from an event monitor on which this reactor has been established. The Reactor provides  application specific procesing of the event.\begin{Desc}
\item[Parameters: ]\par
\begin{description}
\item[{\em 
r\-Monitor}]- The event monitor which fired off our reaction. \item[{\em 
Reason}]- Why we were fired. Can be any of:\begin{CompactItemize}
\item 
Ocurred - the event happened.\item 
Timed\-Out - The event did not happen within the timeout.\item 
Error - Some error occured on the event.\end{CompactItemize}
\end{description}
\end{Desc}
Throws:\begin{CompactItemize}
\item 
{\bf CRange\-Error} {\rm (p.\,\pageref{classCRangeError})} if an invalid Reason was passed in. \end{CompactItemize}
