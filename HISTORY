  1. Corrected expected byte count in DAQLinkInbThread.cc so
     that it is properly calculated for multi-page buffers.

  1. Makefiles now die on errors during submakes.
     Also, "make -k" should force continuation despite a 
     compilation error.  Both these options work when I
     forced a compilation error in a sub-subdirectory. 

  2. The configure script supports a "--enable-verbose-build"
     flag that removes the "@" from the default compilation target
     commands in config.make.  As such, the compilation command
     will be printed after the "Compiling..." message during a
     build if this flag is passed to configure. 
  
  3. The default targets in config.make will cause the compiler
     version to be printed with the "Compiling..." message.
     Can be useful, if you're wondering what compiler is being
     used.

  4. The spectrodaq.conf supports a "--cxx" flag that prints the
     C++ program used to build Spectrodaq.  Can be useful for 
     setting CXX environment vars when building Spectrodaq clients.
     Note, however, if the command is versionless like "c++", and
     the links get updated due the installation of a new compiler,
     the command used may no longer point to the correct compiler.
     Use the "--builtwith" to double check compiler versions.

  5. Status commands (such as tsstat and usedpages) no longer use
     XML processing.  Instead the server output's a plain text
     data stream (a step toward removing XML processing from
     Spectrodaq entirely).
