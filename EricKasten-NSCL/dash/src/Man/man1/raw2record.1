.SH NAME
raw2record \- manual page for raw2record 1.82
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B raw2record
\fI--run=INTEGER --packet=INTEGER \fR[\fIOPTION\fR]...
.SH DESCRIPTION
Convert raw data directly into DSH records.  This program is
not intended as an injection program, but as a primary source that
can consume raw data from stdin and write DSH records on stdout.
Data read from stdin is automagically packaged into well structured
records prior to being written to stdout.  The essential
characteristics of raw2record are as follows:
.PP
1.  Raw2record first emits a BEGINRUN record on stdout.
.PP
2.  Data read from stdin is treated as a stream of bytes.
.PP
3.  Data read from stdin is automagically packaged into
.IP
records and written to raw2record's stdout.
.PP
4.  If raw2record's stdin is closed, or raw2record receives a
.IP
SIGINT, raw2record will emit a ENDRUN record on stdout and
then exit.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-\-version\fR
Output version information and exit
.TP
\fB\-\-help\fR
Display this help and exit
.TP
\fB\-\-debug\fR=\fISECONDS\fR
Output a debugging command and wait SECONDS
before beginning execution of main loop
.TP
\fB\-\-run\fR=\fIINTEGER\fR
Mandatory. Specify experiment run number
.TP
\fB\-\-title\fR=\fISTRING\fR
Experiment title string
.TP
\fB\-\-size\fR=\fIINTEGER\fR
Size of data in bytes to include in each record.
Default 8192 bytes.
.TP

symbolic name for a well known packet type such
as Physics.
.SH EXAMPLES
.IP
raw2record \fB\-\-run\fR=\fI45\fR \fB\-\-packet\fR=\fI104\fR \fB\-\-title=\fR"Experiment number 45"
.IP
Produce records using run number 45 and title
"Experiment number 45."  Records produced from raw
data read from stdin will have a record type of 104.
.IP
raw2record \fB\-\-size\fR=\fI1024\fR \fB\-\-run\fR=\fI51\fR \fB\-\-packet\fR=\fIPhysics\fR
.IP
\fB\-\-title=\fR"Experiment number 51"
.IP
Produce records using run number 51 and title
"Experiment number 51."  Records produced from raw data
read from stdin will have a record type of Physics.  Each
record will contain 1024 bytes of raw data.
