            The <b>Filter->Search Next</b> menu command repeats the
            recently established <a href="search.html">search</a> on the data that has been
            accepted by bufdump.   To establish the initial search, use <a href="filtersearch.html">
            Filter->Search...</a>.  Note that the <b>F3</b> key is a shortcut for
            <b>Filter->Search Next</b>.
