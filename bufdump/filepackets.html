        <p>
            The <em>
                    File->Read Packet Ders...</em>
            menu command prompts for a packet definition file.
            Packet definition files are text files that, by default
            end in the .def file type.  The file prompter, however
            also allows you to select .txt or any file.
        </p>
        <p>
            A packet definition file defines a correspondence between packet id's
            and packet names.  bufdump uses these definitions to format the headers
            of packets in event buffers.   A central packet definition file is loaded
            by the bufdump program when it starts.  This file is packets.def in the
            etc subdirectory of the DAQ installation root on your system.  If your
            facility has developed standard packet types ask your system manager to
            augment the contents of this file.   The initial contents of this file
            represent the packets in known use at the NSCL.
        </p>
        <p>
            The form of a packet definition file is that of a simple text file.
            Each line of the text file defines a packet type.  The fields in each line
            are separated by whitespace.  If a field must have whitespace, it should
            either be enclosd in quotations marks or curly braces.  Below is an extract
            from the standard packets.def packet definition file as an example:
            <br />
            <pre>
                HiRA     0x3100 {HiRA High resolution array} 1.0
                Lassa    0x3200 {Large area Si strip array}  1.0
                Silicon  0x3300 {Silicon detector array}     1.0
                4-pi     0x4000 {4-pi logarithmic detector}  2.0
            </pre>
        </p>
        <p>
            The fields in each line of the file, from left to right are:
            <ol>
                <li><b>Short Name</b> A short name for the packet type.</li>
                <li><b>Id</b> The id of the packet type.  This can be in hexadecimal
                        decimal or octal.  In the sample above, all values are hexadecimal
                        as indicated by the leading 0x.  Octal numbers have  a leading
                        0 (zero).  And decimal numbers  have no leading indicators.</li>
                <li><b>Long Name</b>A long, descsriptive name of the packet type.</li>
                <li><b>Version</b>The current version of the packet type. </li>
            </ol>
        </p>
