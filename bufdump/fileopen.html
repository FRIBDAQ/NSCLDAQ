        <h1>File->Open...</h1>
        <p>
            The <b>File->Open</b> dialog allows you to open a
            <a href="datasource.html">data source</a> from which
            bufdump will read data buffers.
        </p>
        <p>
            Clicking <b>File->Open</b> will bring up the data source
            dialog shown below <br />

        <p>
            As you can see, this dialog is divided into several vertical sections.
            <ol>
                <li>The top section allows you to set the buffersize (the default of
                    8192 is the default buffersize used by the NSCL DAQ system),
                    and selecte between offline and online event sources.</li>
                <li>The second section from the top is disabled, unless the
                    <b>Online</b> box is checked.  This section consists of a text
                    entry box in which you can enter the name of the system that
                    is producing data (e.g. spdaq20.nscl.msu.edu for S800 experiments).</li>
                <li>The third section from the top is only enabled if the
                    <b>Online</b> box is <em>not</em> checked.  It allows you to navigate
                    the filesystem and select an event file.  The top entry allows you to
                    specify a filter that describes which files you may choose from.  The
                    left list box (labelled Diretories) presents the subdirectories in the
                    current directory as well as .. to go up one level in the file system.
                    the right listbox (labelled Files) presents a list of files you can click
                    to select.  Finally, the text entry labelled Selection displays the full
                    path to the file you have currently selected.</li>
                <li>The bottom section provides buttons for actions you may take:
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Ok</b> accepts the data source you have selected and
                            attempts to open it.</li>
                        <li><b>Cancel</b> dismisses the dialog without taking any action</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ol>
