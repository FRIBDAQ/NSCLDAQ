        <h1>The Filter menu</h1>
        <p>
            The <b>Filter</b> menu provides access to commands that allow
            you to selectively view data.  These commands relate to
            <a href="filters.html">buffer filters</a> and <a href="search.html">
            searches</a> within a buffer:
            <ul>
                <li><a href="filterfiter.html">Filter->Filter...</a> establishes
                    a <a href="filters.html">buffer filter</a> to restrict the set
                    of buffers that will be displayed.</li>
                <li><a href="filtersearch.html">Filter->Search...</a>establishes
                    a <a href="search.html">search pattern</a> for data within
                    buffers that have already been displayed.  A search for the
                    first instance of this pattern is the executed.</li>
                <li><a href="filtersearchnext.html">File->Search Next</a> searches
                    for the next instance of the established search pattern.</li>
            </ul>
