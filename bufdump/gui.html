        <h1>Bufdump's graphical user interface</h1>
        <p>
            The bulk of the bufdump graphical user interface is devoted
            to a scrollable text window.  Formatted buffers are displayed in
            this text widget.  Bufdump maintains the formatted output of several
            buffers at a time in the text window so that you can scroll back
            and forth to do comparisons between buffers.  If more text is available
            than can be displayed in the text area scrollbars will be automatically
            added.  The text area will also grow if you resize the window.
        </p>
        <p>
            The top part of the bufdump window contains a menu bar.
            The menubar provides access to most of the commands that
            bufdump supports.
            <ul>
                <li><a href="file.html">File</a> provides access to the
                    commands that open data sources,
                    <a href="packets.html">packet definition files</a>,
                    and <a href="plugins.html">plugin software components</a>
                </li>
                <li><a href="filter.html">Filter</a> provides access to data
                    filtering tools.  Bufdumps data filtering tools allow you
                    to select which buffers it will display and to search for
                    both textual and binary patterns within the buffer.
                </li>
                <li><a href="help.html">Help</a> provides access to the online
                    documentation you are reading at this time
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            Below the text display area is a toolbar.  At present, the only
            button on the tool bar is a forward pointing arrow button.  Clicking
            this button acquires the next buffer from the data source that matches
            the current <a href="filters.html">filter criterion</a>, and displays it
            in the text widget.  If the current filter is complex or corresponds
            to a rare event, this may take some time.
        </p>
        <p> If the current filter
            involves a bit pattern filter, once the buffer has been acquired,
            the text widget will display the region of the buffer that
            contains the first match to this pattern and highlight the
            first few words of the match.  If no bit filter pattern filter
            is in place, the software will display the first section
            of the buffer centered in the text area.
