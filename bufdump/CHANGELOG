        - Recognize that it is possible to get coincidental matches
          on packet ids that are not real and that this just means
          remaining data are not packets rather than a format error.
        - Event::onconfigure -event should not return a value ever..
          just configures and lets the caller call methods to determine
          the results of this configuration.
        - Support buffersizes up to 16Mbytes.
        - Make docbooking a bit more robust.
        - Do a bit more searching for spectcldaq and promt if we can't
          find a daq directory.
