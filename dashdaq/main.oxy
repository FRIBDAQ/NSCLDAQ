      \section sec_intro Introduction

   The NSCL DAQ Super Highway (DASH) is a new concept in data acquisition
   systems.  Recognizing that advances in networking technology make the
   need for traditional data distribution systems obsolete, DASH puts
   data directly to file.  Data analysis is managed offline by reading the
   event files taken during an experiment.  Online a utility simliar to the
   unix tail -f command is used to sample data as it is appended to the
   current event file.

      \section sec_components Components

   This section provides links to software documentation for the various
   subcomponents of the DASH system. 
 
   - \ref sec_exceptions Exceptions
     This component provides a hierarchy of C++ exception classes for
     DASH.  The DASH software will internally throw these exceptions as
     warranted, and you may use them in your code as well.
