      - Fix error in CRingItem copy construction ... if there was a
	payload, the m_pCursor member was not being set to point to the
	end of that payload...leading the CRingItem target to think the
	item was empty.  This was also a problem with operator= which also
	used CRingItem::copyin where the problem lay.
      - Fix various copy in issues with CRingBuffer and subclasses.
	make all the tests pass that should pass and remove those that
	should no longer pass due to changes in the way sampling
	has been done.
Dec 20,2010
      - Fix error in URL parsing that made absolute file urls fail.
	(removed the leading /).
      - Fix error in Gui that prevented event file segments from
	showing up on the status strip.
Dec 31, 2010
      - In readout gui, make links between files symbolic so that they
	port across backup and restores in a different directory tree as
	happens during NSCL experiment closeout.
January 27, 2011
	- Fix up Experiment.tcl so things work on etch systems (for now).
	- Fix errors in copy construction in daq/format.
February 17, 2011	
	- Fix error in event file overwite handling in readoutgui:
	  the softlink must be deleted before being made.
	
March 10, 2011 10.0-004
	- Make ring master wait until the port manager is actually alive
	rather than dying if it isn't.
	- Install VERSION file in make install target.
	- Misc. changes to Makefile.am's and configure.ac so that
	autoreconf isn't so bitchy.
April 8 2011 10.0-005
	- Stop elapsed run timer in readout gui when the run ends.
April 13, 2011 10.0-006

	- Add -textheight switch Readout shell to support running
	  in on displays with limited heights.
	
June 22, 2011 10.0-008
	- Add --deleteonexit switch to stdintoring
	- CRemoteAccess - modify to start stdintoring with --deleteonexit
	  so that the proxy ring is deleted if the remote part of the
	  hoisting pipeline dies.
July 8, 2011 10.0-009
	- Extend length of getpwbyuid buffer in CReadoutMain.cpp it was
	only marginally good for some people with small gecos fields.
August 5, 2011 10.0-010
	- Remove extraneous -lpub from daqstart's Makefile.am.
October 12, 2011 10.0-011
	Fixes for defects in readout framework found when getting CAESAR ready:
	- SBS Makefile did not honor USERCXXFLAGS, USERCCFLAGS nor
 	  USERLDFLAGS support was added in a way that ensures that
	  USERCCFLAGS and USERCXXFLAGS may differ but nonetheless
	  factoring out the common flagsets.
	- Add -D's  to the Makefiel includes so that users accessing VME
	  classes get the fact that we have a mapped interface.
	- Add missing #define __CREADOUTMAIN_H to CReadoutMain.h
	- Fix error in CAENV262Busy - defined GoReady rather than GoClear
	  so it became an abstract class.  Fixed while retaining the
	  GoReady function because we know the workaround kludge/fix won't
	  disappear.
	- Call clear on main scaler bank in CExperiment after the readout
	  so scaler don't continuously increment
	* Work around issues with the documentation getting too big for 
	  docbook2dvi (it segfaults)...by generating man pages and 
	  htmldocs only.
        - Turn off driver tracing in CVMEInterface::Read. oops
	- Lock/unlock VME Interface in trigger main loop for some dwell
	  time.
	- Fix broken -p switch in tcl server.
	- Clear scalers and readout hardware much later in the
 	  initialization game.
	- Fix time handling for scaler reads.
October 17, 2011 10.0-012
	- Move begin run emit to just prior to starting the 
	  atual run itself...so we're not timing the hardware
	  initialization.

October 18, 2011 10.0-013	
	- Stop using run state time for anything but keep computing each
	from 'now' and start stamp.
October 18, 2011 10.0-014
	- Use ns resolutino realtime clock for all CExperiment timing
	to try to get better synch with the scaler trigger clock.
	- Fix error in CRingSelectionPredicate...would not allow the last
	ring item to be fetched until more were in the ring.
October 18, 2011 10.0-015
	- Pull in up to date scaler display program from 8.2..which
	diverged after this forked off.
October 21, 2011 10.0-016
	- Fix Packet/Vpacket macros so that they generate compatibility
	  (word size-field) packets not checking for jumbo-bufferness.
October 24, 2011 10.0-017
	- Add memory barriers on shm operations that write to ensure
	everthing is flushed to shm. - gcc specific code.
	- Add a bit of a safety zone between get/put pointers.
	- Go to a two phase client allocation: first set pid - 0
	  which makes it ineligible for size computation, and claims it
	  for use.  Then set the get pointer and finally set the PID to
	  the actual value making it elligible for size computation.
Nobvember 4, 2011 10.0-018
	- Deal a bit better with pointer skew that can happen as new
	  consumers enter the fray.
	- Play with the tkdumper help file...fix missing link.
	- Provide migration tutorial.
	
November 4, 2011 10.0-019
	- Make stdintoring understand that data are structured not a
	stream.
November 7, 2011 10.0-020
	- If a proxy ring has no producer then restart the pipeline if a
	client attaches.  This provides a way to recover from remote
	system reboot that's much saner.
        - If a ring is deleted then kill its clients.
	- If a get/put/peek operations discoveres the client's PID has
	been co-opted by some other process or released, throw a state
	exception and refuse to perform the operation.  This deals with an
	edge case that should not happen...however better safe than sorry
	especially since the cost is negligible.
	- Require stdintoring have at least a full header in putData
	else the remainder is a residual.
	- Use same run time offset algorithm as scalers for variable dump
	bufs.
November 9-16, 2011 10.0-021

	  logger.
	- Add spectcldaq script that provides an 8.2 compatible SpecTcl
   	  data source.
	- Add spectcldaq.server - Tcp/IP script that provides 8.2
	  compatible hoist of events out to a non daq system.
	- Support using the EVENTLOGGER env varible to select the event
	  logging program.

	  ReadoutShell.
	- Add complete docs for the readout GUI.
November 21-23 2011 10.0-023

	- Fix 2 stupidities in ringtostdout when writes needed to be
	  segmented, both the wrong pointer and wrong count were used in
	  subsequent writes.
	- Fix copy problem in stdintoring -when residual was less than a
	  header the residual was not being moved resulting in corrupted
	  events, hangs and crashes.
	- Remove misguided changes to Ring predicates that were supposed
  	  to  improve sampling case...they actually killed sampling.
	
10.0-024:
November 24-Dec 1, 2011
	- Completed introductory section of comprehensive docs.
	- Fixed error in stdintoring that would not flush the input buffer
	  completely.
	- Fixed error in stdintoring that re-declared the remainnig bytes
	  value which had the bad effect of it never being initialized
	  from the point of view of the code that needed it initalized.
	- Incorporate Dirk's suggestions into the Ring buffer tutoria.

10.0-25
December 7, 2011
	- In ring selection predicates don't block between skips as these
	  can happen quickly.
December 8, 2011
	- Don't delete ring anymore when feeder exits as the code now
	  alows it to be restarted (CRemoteAccess.cpp). 
	- Support the RINGNAME environment variable to set the ring we use
	  in the remote system for eventlog and sclclient.
        - If the ring specified in a URL has a host that maps to the
	  host' localname don't create a proxy ring but connect to the
	  local ring. e.g. if I'm on charlie.nscl.msu.edu and 
	  specify tcp://charlie/fox I'll connect to tcp://localhost
December 12, 2011
	- Truncate long title strings in sbs/readout/CExperiment rather
	  than causing CRingStateChangeItem to throw a range exception.
	- Add title string validation so that users cannot actually enter
	  strings longer than 80 characters..so they are not surprised
 	  that their strings get truncated.

	- Debugged issues with the VMUSB Tcl stuff.
	- Decided how to get pkgIndex to really work properly for lib.
	 where some .so's may have dependencies based on the enclosing

        * Teach glom to put a timestamp in assembled events according to the
          timestamp policy of first, latest, or average.
        * Ensure that all readouts make body headers for all item types
          though many of them will have null timestamps.
        * Add timestamp policy to the GlomParameters item.
        * Ensure that ring selector uses the ring item header to size its writes
          rather than some fancy arithmetic that fails now that we have body
          headers.
        * Get all unit tests to pass.
        * Add GUI element in event builder RDO Callouts to control the glom
          --timestamp-policy switch.
        * Document new format of Glom parametesr ring item and methods/parameters
          that set/get the timestamp policy.
        * Use tclplus deb package if availalble, fallback to local copy in
	  libtcl
	* Encapsulate the SWIG autoconf test in an m4 test.
	* Encapsulate the gengetopt test in an m4 test.
        * Encapsulate the EPICS tests/defs in an m4 test.

	Issue #1953, Issue #1955, Initial not so complete experiment
	editor.
	* Issue #1964 - State manager.
	* Issue #1961, Issue #1965 - Boot manager, knows how to create

	failures as well as failures in the active state to the
	statemanager as FAIL transition requests.
	* Issue #2122 - Documentation of the elements created/changed in
	the experiment configuration Begin/End sprint.

Work on 11.0-rc11 begins
	
        * Fix Bug #2135 - --version switch didn't really work for python programs
          implemented in the rc11 sprint.
        * Add Feature #2139 - Support running the CCUSBReadout from within the
          state/boot manager by adding an --init-script option and ensuring that
          the program runs an event loop for command input rather than just the
          plain old Tcl interpreter loop (this last ensures that Tcl_ThreadQueueEvent
          events are eventually actually executed in the target interpreter/thread).
        * Add Feature #2138 - Support running the VMUSBReadout from within the
          state/boot manager see above for the changes done.
        * Partial fix for Bug #2132 : Schedule Tclserver exit from overriden exit
          command and join with that thread prior to calling Tcl_Exit to ensure
          the event loop mutexes all run down properly.
        * Did similar partial fix for #2132 for CCUSBReadout
	* Fix a couple of issues in scaler display:
	  - S800 dt comes across as -NaN rather than 0 catch that.
	  - Notebook no longer can give me -background just set
	    normalcolor to white
	* Change BufferToRing so that scaler buffers have not body header.
        * Add -timestamp to VMUSB SIS3820 module.
        * In port the CSIS3820 from nextgen to support the 48 bit scalers that
          were added in that release.
	* Fix errors in scaler display related to non-incremental scalers.
	* Remove popup from s800toring on exit.  Put the policy decision
	about what to do when it exits on the user (e.g. ReadoutShell)
	rather than on the script itself.
	* Add Os::blockSignal to allow code to block the delivery of
	specifci signals.
	* Block SIGPIPE in ringtostdin, stdintoring and ringselector to
	fix edge case where the pipe breaks before the write starts.
	* Fix errors with scaler display handling of -width switch.
	
11.0-Rc12
	* Fix Issue #2197 - note that .started and its relatives just get
	  silently deleted, but the first and last issue in this report
	have been fixed by improved error messages in eventLogBundle.tcl
	* Fix Bug #2191  - When a part of the EVB Pipeline downstream of
	the event builder exits, then kill the entire pipeline with
	notification so the restart works correctly.
	* Fix? Bug #2188 - Ensure that all interesting numbers in the
	event orderer gui are rendered as unsigned ints.
	* Fix Bug #2182 as follows: Add key bindings for enter and tab
	that update the --dt value.  So you do need to use one of those to
	commit the value. 
	* Turn off the pop up when s800toring exits.
	* Fix Defect #2253 - Too long title in the Readout GUI makes run
	start fail.
	* Feature #2340 - Use monitor stack to periodically flush partial
	  event buffer.
	* Fix a few threading errors and edge cases with the monitor stack
	* Complete first sprint of new scaler program:

	* Feature #2206 - Users can specify display pages.
	* Feature #2207 - Users can specify display_single lines.
	* Feature #2208 - Users can specify display_ratio lines
	* Feature #2210 - Alarmed scalers are highlighted in color.
	* Feature #2205 - The scaler program can be attached to a ring.
	* Feature #2211, Feature #2212 - Scalers update properly.
	* Feature #2213 - Users get end of run reports.
	* Complete second sprint of new scaler program:
	* Feature #2256 - Users want to see the run duration (show max
	over all sources).
	* Feature #2257 - Show most recent update intervals from all
	sources.
	* Feature #2259 - Users can disable alarms (Checkbutton).
	* Feature #2260 - Users can define a strip chart single parameter.
	* Feature #2263 - Users can define a stripcharted ratio of
	parameters.
	* Feature #2266 - If there is a strip parameter or strip ratio, a
	strip chart will be created.
	* Feature #2268 Scaler events update the strip chart.
	* Feature #2271 End of run produces a postscript of the strip
	chart.
	* Added the 'special' updated version of plotchart to the build.
	* Added features to the plotchart stripchart to allow one to fetch
	current plot limits.
	* Added CAEN xyplotcontainer and related modules to the build.
	* Feature #2457 - added padding in the elapsed time header of the
	new scaler program
	* Feature #2385 - Labeled axes for scaler program strip chart.
	* Feature #2043 - Tested newscaler with multiple data source
	(event builder 	output).
	* Feature #2502 - Added 'blank' command to newscaler config file.

	command. For now this only supports the -timeaxis option.
	* Feature #2397 - Newscaler - default ring to
	tcp://localhost/$tcl_platform(user) 
	* Feature #2388 - new scaler  decimate old data so that we don't
	ever blow away the virtual memory limit.
	* Feature #2400 - Support SCALER_RING containing a list of ring
	URIs.
	* Feature #2391 - newscaler - add a startup script.
	* Feature #2382 - newscaler strip chart trace names relate back to
	the names of the scalers they chart.
	* Feature #2394 - newscaler tabs have a background image that is a
	color that reflects their alarm state - note this shows very bad
	performance when remotely displayed over WAN
	(e.g. comcast)... need to check that this is not bad inside the
	NSCL or look for a better way to do thins).
	* Feature #2406 - Test newscaler integration with a mix of
	incremental and non-incremental scalers.
	* Feature *2409 - Documented newscaler and TclRingBuffer package
	* Fix errors in new scaler display script that happen when there
	is no stripchart.


11.0-rc14
	Note you might think that the simplest way to get a non blocking
	ring selector is to just do non blocking writes and drop ring
	items on the floor once a non blocking write fails.  This is
	vulnerable/complicated because entire ring items must be written
	to stdout and theres no gaurantee the block won't happen in the
	middle of a ring item leaving you wondering if you should be
	continuing to try the write or get data from the ring. The
	architecture chosen instead is to thread the ringselector so that
	there's an output thread that can be blocking and to use a
	CBufferQueue to transmit ring items between the ring reading
	thread and the output thread.  Ring items get dropped when there
	are no free items available for the ring reading thread to put in
	to the transmit queue.  This results in very straightforward logic
	for both the ring reading thread and the output thread:
	
	* Feature #2556  Hoist CBufferQueue from the USB readouts into
	base/thread
	* Feature #559 In the USB readouts, use the CBufferQueue from
	base/thread getting rid of the local versions. (DRY-ness).
	* Feature #2562 add nonblocking get to CBufferQueue
	* feature #2565 add --non-blocking flag to ringselector and
	document it.
	* Feature #2568 have the ringselector create a free and in transit
	buffer queue of CRingItem*
	* Feature 2571 Ensure RingSelectorMain sends data to a buffer
	queue rather than directly outputting it.  If --non-blocking is
	true and a non blocking get from the free list shows there's no
	free items, drop the ring item on the floor.  With --non-blocking
	false, the get of free items is blocking.
	* Feature 2574 Write an output thread that takes the ring items
	from the in transit queue and writes them to stdout.  Start it in
	the ringselector main thread.

	Document the CBufferQueue and CGuardedObject classes that were
	ported to the base/thread libdaqthreads library.
	

11.0-rc15:
	Bug #1946 - INCLUDES symbol in Makefile.am is obsolete.  This has
	been changed to target_CPPFLAGS pretty much everywhere or
	integrated with an existing target_CXXFLAGS definition when that's
	simpler. 
        Feature # 2186 - Tcl ringbuffer package:  Allow ringbuffer usage
        without a ringname so that all ring usages are given.  Provide
        a ringbuffer list subcommand.  This also satisfies Feature #2535
        since users can check for the ringbuffer in the list of names
        returned by ringbuffer list.
        Bug #2343 Document the VMUSBReadout marker command (daqconfig).
        Fix other issues with documentation pages as we try to reduce the warnings.
        Bug #2240 Better formatting for  new scaler display numbers.
        Bug #2242 CDataFormatItem was mis-documented as CRingFormatItem.
        Bug #2238 env is not available for daq/readoutgui/state.tcl fixed.
        Feature #2074 - Add marker command to CCUSBReadout
        Bug #2201 Late fragment statistics did not increment.
        Feature #2628  Added duplicate timestamp (per queue) detection in
	event orderer.
        Bug #2061 Added global flow control to event orderer.
         * Flow control is indicated on the GUI.
         * Flow control is enforced by the connection manager.
         * Flow control is all or nothing.  No data can be received if the
           high water mark is exceeded.
         * High/low water marks ensure that flow control does not oscillate
           too severely.
         * High/low water marks are in terms of bytes of fragment payload and.
           There are commands to set these they default to a  high water mark
           of 100Mbytes and low water mark of 80Mbytes.
        
11.0-rc16:
	*  Bug #2073 Properly interpret bit 12 of VMUSB buffer header as part of the
	number of events in the buffer.
	*  Bug #2057 A - add -incremental option to VMUSBReadout stack module
	driver so that the scalers ring items can be marked as
	incremental.
	*  Bug #2057 B - add -incremental option to CCUSBReadout stack module
	driver as well.
        *  Feature #2355 Add support for ABNORMAL_END ring items to the system.
        *  Feature #2346 Enable BufferToRing to produce body headers if
        desired or specified by user.
        *  Feature #1826 - Tell user when xxUSBReadout config file exceeds
	the available stack space.
        *  Feature #2173 - Provide VMUSB-tcl package.
        *  Feature #2975 - Add ability to place callout bundle anywhere in the
                        ordered list of registered callout bundles.
        *  Bug #2130 - Don't allow a new run to start until the event builder
                    has flushed all its data out the output ring.
        *  Feature #2099  - Add put(char* data, int nbytes) method to CDataSink interface
        *  Bug #2034 - ringFragmentSources register to wrong event builder when
        starting duplicate event builder.  Note this may  not really fix the
        issue of a hanging event building pipeline since the next thing you're
        likely to run into is that glom is still alive and is the ring producer
        so the new pipeline won't start up right uniless the destination ring
        is modified.
        *  Feature #868 - Remove NSCLDAQ's dependency on BLT as that is not being
        sufficiently supported for me to have confidence that it won't break (again)
        when we go to Tcl 8.6
        *  Bug #2915 - Don't emit body headers if there's no scaler timestamp extractor.
        - Add try/catch block around the action register write that
	triggers the vmusbreadout monitor list as this intermittently
	fails.
11.0-rc17 (Evidently I was not keeping up with starting new release candidates above).
        *  Feature #3175 - ringFragmentSource stuff that used to go to source#.txt now goes
        to stderr which in turn goes to an output window tab of the UI.
        *  Feature #3205 - Only end run if the state is active or paused...this prevents
        attempting to end the run while the rdothread is busy initializing the run.
        *  Bug #3208 - Set paused state when pausing run so that resume is allowed.
        Feature #3164 - For event builder windows put functional titles in that also
        give a disambiguating username.
        *  Bug #3155 - Don't emit EOF message in compatibilitybuffer method.
        *  Feature #3202 - Don't let exceptions propagate out of the reaout thread into the
        last chance exception handler.
        *  Feature #3229 - Make timestamp extractors for XXUSBReadout aware of run starts
        *  Bug #3238 - Fix VMUSBReadout OutputThread fails when run title is too long
        *  Bug #3235 - Loop over drain/retries on writing the action register.  Note that the
           original trigger was Bug #3238 which is fixed in this release as well.
        *  Feature #3232 - Add mechanism to get the source id from sbsReadout CDExperiment objects
        and document how to have an event segment produce its own event segments.
        *  Feature #3217 - Provide indications of the Eventbuilder queue depth and throughputs in
        bytes/sec.
        *  Feature #3220 - Add Event builder diagnostics/display for out of order timestamps
          in the input queue(s).
        *  Feature #3223 - Diagnostic for output ring full - implemented as a tab on
          the status display that  provides the output ring statistics.  This allows
          users to see where the output ring buffers are rather than just an output ring
          full indicator.
        *  Feature #3161 - Here be dragons!!! save the stagearea value set in the
          UI in the ~/stagearea/.settings.tcl file.  This may surprise test users.
        *  Feature #3274:
	   *   Add class CriticalSection safe critical sections via mutex (base/thread)
	   *   Add Mutex to CXXUSB classes and encapsulate
	      writeActionRegister, transaction and readUSB in a
              CriticalSection to make the libusb stuff all thread
              protected.
	   *   Add a marker slow control module so any periodic flush of
	      the physics buffer is at the discretion of the experimenter.
       *  Merged rc17 development branch to nscldaq-11.0 development branch.
11.0-rc18
       * Bug #3367 - Swap order of type/name in the CCUSB TclServer Module command.
       * Bug #2033 - If the file exists in /dev/shm but is not known by the ring
         master when CRingBuffer::Create take action as follows:  If the file is
         formatted as a ring buffer, just re-register it.  If the file is not
         formatted as a ring buffer, then throw an error.
       * Bug #3325 - Clean up the way that data source exits are handled in the readout GUI
         specifically;
         *  Had been first transitioning to Ready then NotReady...just go directly to notready.
         *  In event log bundle {Active, Paused} -> NotReady kills eventlogger
            does a clean run finalization.
         *  In event builder these transitions kill off the event bulder.
       * Bug #3400 - Event builder should protect itself from attempts to register the bundle
         more than once.  Note that this makes the docs correct as it does not hurt to
         useEventBuilder in the OnStart without protection.
       * Fix error that -inrate would go negative if the event builder was
	used persistently because of the counter resets.  If the rates
	look negative assume there's been a reset.  Note for _very long_
	runs (more than 4billion [2^32] or is it 2^64 fragents in a queue), there
	may be one update cycle with an inaccurate rate because of the
	counter wrap.  I'm not going to worry about that now.  What would
	be needed to worry about it is knowledge in the GUI of when a
	reset happens so that wraps are handled properly and resets set
	the last counters to zero instead.
