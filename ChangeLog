      - Fix error in CRingItem copy construction ... if there was a
	payload, the m_pCursor member was not being set to point to the
	end of that payload...leading the CRingItem target to think the
	item was empty.  This was also a problem with operator= which also
	used CRingItem::copyin where the problem lay.
      - Fix various copy in issues with CRingBuffer and subclasses.
	make all the tests pass that should pass and remove those that
	should no longer pass due to changes in the way sampling
	has been done.

      - Fix error in Gui that prevented event file segments from
	showing up on the status strip.

      - In readout gui, make links between files symbolic so that they
	port across backup and restores in a different directory tree as
	happens during NSCL experiment closeout.

	- Make ring master wait until the port manager is actually alive
	rather than dying if it isn't.

	- Misc. changes to Makefile.am's and configure.ac so that
	autoreconf isn't so bitchy.
