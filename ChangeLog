      - Fix error in CRingItem copy construction ... if there was a
	payload, the m_pCursor member was not being set to point to the
	end of that payload...leading the CRingItem target to think the
	item was empty.  This was also a problem with operator= which also
	used CRingItem::copyin where the problem lay.
      - Fix various copy in issues with CRingBuffer and subclasses.
	make all the tests pass that should pass and remove those that
	should no longer pass due to changes in the way sampling
	has been done.
Dec 20,2010
      - Fix error in URL parsing that made absolute file urls fail.
	(removed the leading /).
      - Fix error in Gui that prevented event file segments from
	showing up on the status strip.
Dec 31, 2010
      - In readout gui, make links between files symbolic so that they
	port across backup and restores in a different directory tree as
	happens during NSCL experiment closeout.
January 27, 2011
	- Fix up Experiment.tcl so things work on etch systems (for now).
	- Fix errors in copy construction in daq/format.
February 17, 2011	
	- Fix error in event file overwite handling in readoutgui:
	  the softlink must be deleted before being made.
	
March 10, 2011 10.0-004
	- Make ring master wait until the port manager is actually alive
	rather than dying if it isn't.
	- Install VERSION file in make install target.
	- Misc. changes to Makefile.am's and configure.ac so that
	autoreconf isn't so bitchy.
April 8 2011 10.0-005
	- Stop elapsed run timer in readout gui when the run ends.
April 13, 2011 10.0-006

	- Add -textheight switch Readout shell to support running
	  in on displays with limited heights.
	
June 22, 2011 10.0-008
	- Add --deleteonexit switch to stdintoring
	- CRemoteAccess - modify to start stdintoring with --deleteonexit
	  so that the proxy ring is deleted if the remote part of the
	  hoisting pipeline dies.
July 8, 2011 10.0-009
	- Extend length of getpwbyuid buffer in CReadoutMain.cpp it was
	only marginally good for some people with small gecos fields.
August 5, 2011 10.0-010
	- Remove extraneous -lpub from daqstart's Makefile.am.
October 12, 2011 10.0-011
	Fixes for defects in readout framework found when getting CAESAR ready:
	- SBS Makefile did not honor USERCXXFLAGS, USERCCFLAGS nor
 	  USERLDFLAGS support was added in a way that ensures that
	  USERCCFLAGS and USERCXXFLAGS may differ but nonetheless
	  factoring out the common flagsets.
	- Add -D's  to the Makefiel includes so that users accessing VME
	  classes get the fact that we have a mapped interface.
	- Add missing #define __CREADOUTMAIN_H to CReadoutMain.h
	- Fix error in CAENV262Busy - defined GoReady rather than GoClear
	  so it became an abstract class.  Fixed while retaining the
	  GoReady function because we know the workaround kludge/fix won't
	  disappear.
	- Call clear on main scaler bank in CExperiment after the readout
	  so scaler don't continuously increment
	* Work around issues with the documentation getting too big for 
	  docbook2dvi (it segfaults)...by generating man pages and 
	  htmldocs only.
        - Turn off driver tracing in CVMEInterface::Read. oops
	- Lock/unlock VME Interface in trigger main loop for some dwell
	  time.
	- Fix broken -p switch in tcl server.
	- Clear scalers and readout hardware much later in the
 	  initialization game.
	- Fix time handling for scaler reads.
October 17, 2011 10.0-012
	- Move begin run emit to just prior to starting the 
	  atual run itself...so we're not timing the hardware
	  initialization.

October 18, 2011 10.0-013	
	- Stop using run state time for anything but keep computing each
	from 'now' and start stamp.
October 18, 2011 10.0-014
	- Use ns resolutino realtime clock for all CExperiment timing
	to try to get better synch with the scaler trigger clock.
	- Fix error in CRingSelectionPredicate...would not allow the last
	ring item to be fetched until more were in the ring.
October 18, 2011 10.0-015
	- Pull in up to date scaler display program from 8.2..which
	diverged after this forked off.
October 21, 2011 10.0-016
	- Fix Packet/Vpacket macros so that they generate compatibility
	  (word size-field) packets not checking for jumbo-bufferness.
October 24, 2011 10.0-017
	- Add memory barriers on shm operations that write to ensure
	everthing is flushed to shm. - gcc specific code.
	- Add a bit of a safety zone between get/put pointers.
	- Go to a two phase client allocation: first set pid - 0
	  which makes it ineligible for size computation, and claims it
	  for use.  Then set the get pointer and finally set the PID to
	  the actual value making it elligible for size computation.
Nobvember 4, 2011 10.0-018
	- Deal a bit better with pointer skew that can happen as new
	  consumers enter the fray.
	- Play with the tkdumper help file...fix missing link.
	- Provide migration tutorial.
	
November 4, 2011 10.0-019
	- Make stdintoring understand that data are structured not a
	stream.
November 7, 2011 10.0-020
	- If a proxy ring has no producer then restart the pipeline if a
	client attaches.  This provides a way to recover from remote
	system reboot that's much saner.
        - If a ring is deleted then kill its clients.
	- If a get/put/peek operations discoveres the client's PID has
	been co-opted by some other process or released, throw a state
	exception and refuse to perform the operation.  This deals with an
	edge case that should not happen...however better safe than sorry
	especially since the cost is negligible.
	- Require stdintoring have at least a full header in putData
	else the remainder is a residual.
	- Use same run time offset algorithm as scalers for variable dump
	bufs.
November 9-16, 2011 10.0-021

	  logger.
	- Add spectcldaq script that provides an 8.2 compatible SpecTcl
   	  data source.
	- Add spectcldaq.server - Tcp/IP script that provides 8.2
	  compatible hoist of events out to a non daq system.
	- Support using the EVENTLOGGER env varible to select the event
	  logging program.

	  ReadoutShell.
	- Add complete docs for the readout GUI.
November 21-23 2011 10.0-023

	- Fix 2 stupidities in ringtostdout when writes needed to be
	  segmented, both the wrong pointer and wrong count were used in
	  subsequent writes.
	- Fix copy problem in stdintoring -when residual was less than a
	  header the residual was not being moved resulting in corrupted
	  events, hangs and crashes.
	- Remove misguided changes to Ring predicates that were supposed
  	  to  improve sampling case...they actually killed sampling.
	
10.0-024:
November 24-Dec 1, 2011
	- Completed introductory section of comprehensive docs.
	- Fixed error in stdintoring that would not flush the input buffer
	  completely.
	- Fixed error in stdintoring that re-declared the remainnig bytes
	  value which had the bad effect of it never being initialized
	  from the point of view of the code that needed it initalized.
	- Incorporate Dirk's suggestions into the Ring buffer tutoria.

10.0-25
December 7, 2011
	- In ring selection predicates don't block between skips as these
	  can happen quickly.
December 8, 2011
	- Don't delete ring anymore when feeder exits as the code now
	  alows it to be restarted (CRemoteAccess.cpp). 
	- Support the RINGNAME environment variable to set the ring we use
	  in the remote system for eventlog and sclclient.
        - If the ring specified in a URL has a host that maps to the
	  host' localname don't create a proxy ring but connect to the
	  local ring. e.g. if I'm on charlie.nscl.msu.edu and 
	  specify tcp://charlie/fox I'll connect to tcp://localhost
December 12, 2011
	- Truncate long title strings in sbs/readout/CExperiment rather
	  than causing CRingStateChangeItem to throw a range exception.
	- Add title string validation so that users cannot actually enter
	  strings longer than 80 characters..so they are not surprised
 	  that their strings get truncated.

	- Debugged issues with the VMUSB Tcl stuff.
	- Decided how to get pkgIndex to really work properly for lib.
	 where some .so's may have dependencies based on the enclosing

        * Teach glom to put a timestamp in assembled events according to the
          timestamp policy of first, latest, or average.
        * Ensure that all readouts make body headers for all item types
          though many of them will have null timestamps.
        * Add timestamp policy to the GlomParameters item.
        * Ensure that ring selector uses the ring item header to size its writes
          rather than some fancy arithmetic that fails now that we have body
          headers.
        * Get all unit tests to pass.
        * Add GUI element in event builder RDO Callouts to control the glom
          --timestamp-policy switch.
        * Document new format of Glom parametesr ring item and methods/parameters
          that set/get the timestamp policy.
        * Use tclplus deb package if availalble, fallback to local copy in
	  libtcl
	* Encapsulate the SWIG autoconf test in an m4 test.
	* Encapsulate the gengetopt test in an m4 test.
        * Encapsulate the EPICS tests/defs in an m4 test.
11.0-rc3 Sprint for DDAS SBC reaodout board and then some.
	* Issue #1765 - open rc3 development sprint.
	* Issue #433  - Support out of tree builds.
	* Issue #1045 - Pure plugin architecture for ReadoutShell.
	* Task  #1729 - Add --run switch to eventlog so ReadoutGui can
	     explicitly set the run number.
	* Changing the bogus ReadougGUIPanel -> ReadoutGUIPanel as it
	always should have been if I'd not been so lazy.
	* Added documentation for ReadoutGUIPanel::Log method.
        * Issue #1045 - Redo event GUI to support multiple readouts.
        *   Add control over readout gui's log window charact>eristics
        *   Add sshPipe provider wd parameter.
        *   Expose that parameter in the prompter for the source in the
	gui.
	* Issue #1654 better document the CEventSegment methods for
	handling event rejection and timestap/event source injection.
	* Fold in fix for double de-alloc in CConfigurable object from
	Jeromy.
	* Issue #1876 Ensure all output is captured by the ssh pipe
	(stupid redirection tricks).

11.0-rc4  Misc fixes.
	* Issue #1760  - Don't rethrow exception in XXUSB CTheApplication.cpp
	operator() -- just exit since there's no other exception handler.
	* Remove lines/cols from outputwindow settings...it's now resizeable
        * Issue #1850 - Add skeleton build tests to Jenkins job.l
	* Issue #1824 - Add and install documentation for unglom.
        * Issue #1761 - Make the xxusbReadout frameworks not output versions
          by default and synch their versions with nscldaq version when
          used with the --version option.

	one in nsclapi over the one in vmemodules.
        * Issue #1827 - Add --scaler-width option to dumper to deal with 
	   X/Q bits in CCUSB Scalers e.g.  This was done by introducing a
	public static attribute CRingScalerItem::m_ScalerFormatMask which
	toString ands with scaler values.
	* Issue #1825 - Document SBS readout commands and key variables.

11.0-rc5 
	* Issue #1834 - Add SBS and vmsub firmware upgraders for CAEN
	products.
	* Issue #1878 - Add documentation for the SBS Scripted readout
	framework. 
	* Issue #1721 - Remove use of usleep as that's posix deprecated.
	This was done by creating an Os::usleep function that used
	nanosleep which is still posix good and rewriting all uses of
	usleep as Os::usleep.
	* Issue #1762 add exit handlers to XXUSBReadout so that if the process exits
	with acquisition active the XXUSB controller is told to exit
	acquisition mode and buffers are dumped.	
        * Issue #1899 Add dcoumentation for glom.
        * Roll in Jeromy's fix for s800 ring data source startup in evb

	* Issue #700 Support user written drivers for VM-USB slow controls
	server.
	* Issue #544 Provide a convenience function to make range checked

	firmware file that is the serial number string (e.g. V1234).
	
Open rc7 work.
	*  Get good compilation/tests on Ubunti 14.04 (trusty).
	*  Modify default size in CRingItem so that instatiation
	   with default size does not cause dynamic buffer allocation.
	*  Ensure that failure to build/install documentation won't cause
	build failure (e.g. user does not have docbook installed on
	system).
