      - Fix error in CRingItem copy construction ... if there was a
	payload, the m_pCursor member was not being set to point to the
	end of that payload...leading the CRingItem target to think the
	item was empty.  This was also a problem with operator= which also
	used CRingItem::copyin where the problem lay.
      - Fix various copy in issues with CRingBuffer and subclasses.
	make all the tests pass that should pass and remove those that
	should no longer pass due to changes in the way sampling
	has been done.
Dec 20,2010
      - Fix error in URL parsing that made absolute file urls fail.
	(removed the leading /).
      - Fix error in Gui that prevented event file segments from
	showing up on the status strip.
Dec 31, 2010
      - In readout gui, make links between files symbolic so that they
	port across backup and restores in a different directory tree as
	happens during NSCL experiment closeout.
January 27, 2011
	- Fix up Experiment.tcl so things work on etch systems (for now).
	- Fix errors in copy construction in daq/format.
February 17, 2011	
	- Fix error in event file overwite handling in readoutgui:
	  the softlink must be deleted before being made.
	
March 10, 2011 10.0-004
	- Make ring master wait until the port manager is actually alive
	rather than dying if it isn't.
	- Install VERSION file in make install target.
	- Misc. changes to Makefile.am's and configure.ac so that
	autoreconf isn't so bitchy.
April 8 2011 10.0-005
	- Stop elapsed run timer in readout gui when the run ends.
April 13, 2011 10.0-006

	- Add -textheight switch Readout shell to support running
	  in on displays with limited heights.
	
June 22, 2011 10.0-008
	- Add --deleteonexit switch to stdintoring
	- CRemoteAccess - modify to start stdintoring with --deleteonexit
	  so that the proxy ring is deleted if the remote part of the
	  hoisting pipeline dies.
July 8, 2011 10.0-009
	- Extend length of getpwbyuid buffer in CReadoutMain.cpp it was
	only marginally good for some people with small gecos fields.
August 5, 2011 10.0-010
	- Remove extraneous -lpub from daqstart's Makefile.am.
October 12, 2011 10.0-011
	Fixes for defects in readout framework found when getting CAESAR ready:
	- SBS Makefile did not honor USERCXXFLAGS, USERCCFLAGS nor
 	  USERLDFLAGS support was added in a way that ensures that
	  USERCCFLAGS and USERCXXFLAGS may differ but nonetheless
	  factoring out the common flagsets.
	- Add -D's  to the Makefiel includes so that users accessing VME
	  classes get the fact that we have a mapped interface.
	- Add missing #define __CREADOUTMAIN_H to CReadoutMain.h
	- Fix error in CAENV262Busy - defined GoReady rather than GoClear
	  so it became an abstract class.  Fixed while retaining the
	  GoReady function because we know the workaround kludge/fix won't
	  disappear.
	- Call clear on main scaler bank in CExperiment after the readout
	  so scaler don't continuously increment
	* Work around issues with the documentation getting too big for 
	  docbook2dvi (it segfaults)...by generating man pages and 
	  htmldocs only.
        - Turn off driver tracing in CVMEInterface::Read. oops
	- Lock/unlock VME Interface in trigger main loop for some dwell
	  time.
	- Fix broken -p switch in tcl server.
	- Clear scalers and readout hardware much later in the
 	  initialization game.
	- Fix time handling for scaler reads.
October 17, 2011 10.0-012
	- Move begin run emit to just prior to starting the 
	  atual run itself...so we're not timing the hardware
	  initialization.

October 18, 2011 10.0-013	
	- Stop using run state time for anything but keep computing each
	from 'now' and start stamp.
October 18, 2011 10.0-014
	- Use ns resolutino realtime clock for all CExperiment timing
	to try to get better synch with the scaler trigger clock.
	- Fix error in CRingSelectionPredicate...would not allow the last
	ring item to be fetched until more were in the ring.
October 18, 2011 10.0-015
	- Pull in up to date scaler display program from 8.2..which
	diverged after this forked off.
October 21, 2011 10.0-016
	- Fix Packet/Vpacket macros so that they generate compatibility
	  (word size-field) packets not checking for jumbo-bufferness.
October 24, 2011 10.0-017
	- Add memory barriers on shm operations that write to ensure
	everthing is flushed to shm. - gcc specific code.
	- Add a bit of a safety zone between get/put pointers.
	- Go to a two phase client allocation: first set pid - 0
	  which makes it ineligible for size computation, and claims it
	  for use.  Then set the get pointer and finally set the PID to
	  the actual value making it elligible for size computation.
Nobvember 4, 2011 10.0-018
	- Deal a bit better with pointer skew that can happen as new
	  consumers enter the fray.
	- Play with the tkdumper help file...fix missing link.
	- Provide migration tutorial.
	
November 4, 2011 10.0-019
	- Make stdintoring understand that data are structured not a
	stream.
November 7, 2011 10.0-020
	- If a proxy ring has no producer then restart the pipeline if a
	client attaches.  This provides a way to recover from remote
	system reboot that's much saner.
        - If a ring is deleted then kill its clients.
	- If a get/put/peek operations discoveres the client's PID has
	been co-opted by some other process or released, throw a state
	exception and refuse to perform the operation.  This deals with an
	edge case that should not happen...however better safe than sorry
	especially since the cost is negligible.
	- Require stdintoring have at least a full header in putData
	else the remainder is a residual.
	- Use same run time offset algorithm as scalers for variable dump
	bufs.
November 9-16, 2011 10.0-021
	- Add --exitonend option to ringselector (WO W00957).

	  logger.
	- Add spectcldaq script that provides an 8.2 compatible SpecTcl
   	  data source.
	- Add spectcldaq.server - Tcp/IP script that provides 8.2
	  compatible hoist of events out to a non daq system.
	- Support using the EVENTLOGGER env varible to select the event
	  logging program.
	- Provide docs for the compatibility mode utilities in the
	  utilities sections of the general docs and its own section of

	  ReadoutShell.
	- Add complete docs for the readout GUI.
November 21-23 2011 10.0-023
	- Introductory docs for the grand unified documentation begun.
	- Fix 2 stupidities in ringtostdout when writes needed to be
	  segmented, both the wrong pointer and wrong count were used in
	  subsequent writes.
	- Fix copy problem in stdintoring -when residual was less than a
	  header the residual was not being moved resulting in corrupted
	  events, hangs and crashes.
	- Remove misguided changes to Ring predicates that were supposed
  	  to  improve sampling case...they actually killed sampling.
	
10.0-024:
November 24-Dec 1, 2011
	- Completed introductory section of comprehensive docs.
	- Fixed error in stdintoring that would not flush the input buffer
	  completely.
	- Fixed error in stdintoring that re-declared the remainnig bytes
	  value which had the bad effect of it never being initialized
	  from the point of view of the code that needed it initalized.
	- Incorporate Dirk's suggestions into the Ring buffer tutoria.

10.0-25
December 7, 2011
	- In ring selection predicates don't block between skips as these
	  can happen quickly.
December 8, 2011
	- Don't delete ring anymore when feeder exits as the code now
	  alows it to be restarted (CRemoteAccess.cpp). 
	- Support the RINGNAME environment variable to set the ring we use
	  in the remote system for eventlog and sclclient.
        - If the ring specified in a URL has a host that maps to the
	  host' localname don't create a proxy ring but connect to the
	  local ring. e.g. if I'm on charlie.nscl.msu.edu and 
	  specify tcp://charlie/fox I'll connect to tcp://localhost
December 12, 2011
	- Truncate long title strings in sbs/readout/CExperiment rather
	  than causing CRingStateChangeItem to throw a range exception.
	- Add title string validation so that users cannot actually enter
	  strings longer than 80 characters..so they are not surprised
 	  that their strings get truncated.

	- Decided how to get pkgIndex to really work properly for lib.
	 where some .so's may have dependencies based on the enclosing
