\subsection{Detailed Description}
Base class for file descriptor reactors: Fd reactors react to events on a file descriptor. This abstract base class must be subclassed by the programmer to provide application specific behavior.

\subsubsection{\setlength{\rightskip}{0pt plus 5cm}CFd\-Reactor::CFd\-Reactor ()}\label{classCFdReactor_a0}


Default constructor: Creates a file descriptor reactor which autonamed. Such fd reactors in general are not named in a memorable way.

\subsubsection{\setlength{\rightskip}{0pt plus 5cm}void CFd\-Reactor::On\-Event ({\bf CEvent\-Monitor} \& {\em r\-Monitor})\hspace{0.3cm}{\tt  [virtual]}}\label{classCFdReactor_a5}


EDispatches an incomming event from an Fd\-Monitor to one or more of the following member functions:\begin{CompactItemize}
\item 
On\-Readble - The file is readable.\item 
On\-Writable - The file is writable.\item 
On\-Exception - The file has an exceptional condition.\end{CompactItemize}
NOTE: We can only dispatch to conditions the monitor is looking for.

Throws:\begin{CompactItemize}
\item 
CIncompatible\-Monitor\-Exception - If the monitor cannot be cast to a {\bf CFd\-Monitor} {\rm (p.\,\pageref{classCFdMonitor})} object.\end{CompactItemize}
\begin{Desc}
\item[Parameters: ]\par
\begin{description}
\item[{\em 
r\-Monitor}]- Reference to the monitor which caused us to be invoked. This should be an object which lives in the {\bf CFd\-Monitor} {\rm (p.\,\pageref{classCFdMonitor})} branch of the CMonitor class hierarchy. \end{description}
\end{Desc}

Called when the file associated with the event monitor has an \char`\"{}exceptional condition\char`\"{}.. Actual use of this Reactor involves subclassing the monitor and overriding On\-Exception if you care about processing exceptional conditions.
