## The ccusbcamac namespace
# 
# This package provides a purely tcl package for executing remote commands to 
# a CCUSB being run by the CCUSBReadout program. It is compatible with the 
# wienercamac package in that it presents the user with the same interface.
# There are a few differences that occur due to the nature of this being
# a client to the CCUSBReadout slow-controls server. The main one being that
# before any call to a cdreg is allowed, a call to cdconn needs to be 
# made with the same branch and crate indices. The reason for this is because
# the cdreg creates a new cccusb::CCCUSBRemote object that requires knowledge
# of the hostname, port, and module name. The purpose of cdconn is to register
# these values to a dictionary whose keys are uniquely formed by the b and c.
# If these have not been created, then there is not way for cdreg to acquire
# the information it needs to make a connection. 
#
# Because this is only the client side of the package, it is not enough to just
# require this package and start using it. For it to be effective, the user must
# add something of the following to their ctlconfig.tcl
#
# @verbatim
# Module create ccusb ctlr
# @endverbatim
#
# Adding such a line to the ctlconfig.tcl file and then running the CCUSBReadout
# program on localhost with the slow-controls server listening on port 27000, 
# you would establish a registry for a device in slot 12 as:
# 
# \code
# package require ccusbcamac
# 
# # Provide the connection info
# ccusbcamac::cdconn 0 1 localhost 27000 ctlr
#
# # Connect 
# set reg [ccusbcamac::cdreg 0 1 12]
# \endcode
# 
#
namespace eval ccusbcamac {

  variable connectionInfo "" ;#< dict of connection info mapped to id

  variable lastReg ""        ;#< maintains last reg produced by cdreg (useful for tests)


  
  
  ## @brief Register connection information for b and c
  #
  # The host, port, namd name values are stored in a dict
  # whose key is a unique number produced by b and c (@seealso _computeIndex)
  # It is required that this proc be called prior to calling
  # cdreg because without doing so, cdreg will not have all 
  # of the necessary information to connect to the slow-controls server. 
  # Connection information is stored as a list of the form {host port name}.

  # @param name  name of module loaded into slow-controls server

  # in the connectionInfo dictionary associated with the b and c. This could
  # promptly exit. The user can avoid this situation by calling ccusbcamac::isOnline b c
  # to safely determine whether the server is up and accepting connections.
