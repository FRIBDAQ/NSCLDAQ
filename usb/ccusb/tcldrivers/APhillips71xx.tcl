  #  @returns register value with QX encoded in bits 24 and 24.

  ## @brief Sets the module's programming mode
  #
  # This is useful for writing or reading the pedestal, lower thresh, and upper
  # thresh values. To write any of those values, you actually can bypass this
  # function and just call either SetPedestals, SetLowerThresholds, or
  # SetUpperThresholds b/c they implicitly call this function. However, if you
  # want to read back the values, you would use this method to choose what type
  # of data to access and then read the data using a subsequent call to
  # GetLastProgrammedData. The mapping for the mode are as follows:
  #
  # mode: 
  #   0 - pedestal
  #   1 - lower thresholds
  #   2 - upper thresholds
  #   4 - test mode
  #
  # @param mode   value indicating which type of data to access
  #
  public method SetProgrammingMode {mode} {
    return [Execute 1 [list sSetProgrammingMode $mode]]
  }

  ## @brief Write the pedestals to memory
  #
  # This implicitly calls the SetProgrammingMode with an argument of 0 and then 
  # writes the entire list of pedestal values. Provided a list of n pedestal
  # values, the method will write pedestals to the first n channels of the
  # device. If more than 16 pedestal values are provided, the excess values will
  # be ignored. The pedestals values must be provided in the range [-4095,4095].
  #
  #  @param peds  a list of pedestal values
  #
  #  @throws error if any one pedestal value is out of range
  public method SetPedestals {peds} {
    Execute 1 [list sSetPedestals $peds]
  }

  ## @brief Write the lower thresholds to memory
  #
  # This implicitly calls the SetProgrammingMode with an argument of 1 and then 
  # writes the entire list of threshold values. Provided a list of n threshold
  # values, the method will write to the first n channels of the
  # device. If more than 16 threshold values are provided, the excess values will
  # be ignored. The threshold values must be provided in the range [0,4095].
  #
  #  @param peds  a list of threshold values
  #
  #  @throws error if any one threshold value is out of range
  public method SetLowerThresholds {lth} {
    Execute 1 [list sSetLowerThresholds $lth]
  }

  ## @brief Write the upper thresholds to memory
  #
  # This implicitly calls the SetProgrammingMode with an argument of 2 and then 
  # writes the entire list of threshold values. Provided a list of n threshold
  # values, the method will write to the first n channels of the
  # device. If more than 16 threshold values are provided, the excess values will
  # be ignored. The threshold values must be provided in the range [0,4095].
  #

  #
  #  @throws error if any one threshold value is out of range
  public method SetUpperThresholds {uth} {
    Execute 1 [list sSetUpperThresholds $uth]
  }

  ## @brief Read 16 channels of data corresponding to last set programming mode
  #
  # this is to be used in conjunction with the SetProgrammingMode method. The
  # data returned from this method corresponds to the mode set previously by
  # SetProgrammingMode. For example, if the user call SetProgrammingMode with an
  # argument of 1 (i.e. lower thresholds), the 16 channels of lower threshold
  # values will be returned from this.
  #
  # @returns  list of 16 values corresponding to last set programming mode

  # Utility methods



  ## @brief Process stack consisting of commands created by a method 
  #
  # Given a list whose first element is a proc name and subsequent elements are
  # arguments (i.e. procname arg0 arg1 arg2 ...) , this creates a stack
  #
  #  procname stack arg0 arg1 arg2 ...
  #  
  #  This is useful for converting the various stack building scripts into
  #  single-shot operations. For example the user can read the control register
  #  by calling
  #
  #  $obj Execute [list sReadControlRegister]
  #
  #  note that this is exactly how the single-shot operations are implemented.
  #
  #  @param script  list of form {procname arg0 arg1 arg2 ...}
  #
  #  @returns resulting data as a tcl list of 32-bit words  
  #
  private method Execute {grouping script}


  ## @brief Compare data read from the device with an expected set of values
  #
  # This handles the fact that data read from the device have an XQ value
  # encoded in bits 24 and 25. This method traverses both lists and compares the
  # lower 24 bits of each element for equality. 
  #
  # @param  expected  list of values to compare against
  # @param  readback  list of values to compare with possible XQ encoding
  #
  # @returns boolean
