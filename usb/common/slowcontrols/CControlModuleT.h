/**!
  A control module is a configurable object that owns an object
  derived from CControlHardwareT. 
  - This object maintains the configuration for the module.
  - This object defines and delegates to the CControlHardwareT object
  the following functions:
  - Update  - Updates the internal state of the object from the hardware.
  - Set     - Sets some controllable point in the hardware to a new value
  - Get     - Retreives the value of some controllable point in the hardware
              from the most recently updated values.
  - addMonitorList - Adds operations to execute periodically
  - processMonitorList - Processes data produced by periodic executions
  - getMonitorList - Provides access to most recently received data
      

  Hardware objects must also implement onAttach, which is called when
  the hardware is attached to the configuration.  The hardware is required
  to register configuration parameters (e.g. -base or -slot) with the 
  configuration at that time.

  In delegating these operations, CControlModuleT takes care to synchronize
  with the readout thread if necessary, so that the
  individual hardware modules can be written without any knowledge of
  the existence of the readout thread.

  This is a template that was defined with the CVMUSB and CCCUSB classes
  in mind for the Ctlr template parameter. It need n t be used with those, 
  however, if some other controller implements the proper functionality.
