## @brief A convenience snit::type for encapsulating the options
#
snit::type MDGG16AppOptions {
  option -module  -default {}
  option -host  -default localhost
  option -port  -default 27000
  option -configfile -default ""

  constructor {args} {
    $self configurelist $args
  }
}


## @brief The main snit::type that stitches all of the pieces together
#
# This owns the device handle, main view, and main presenter. It manages the set
# up of the menu bar by adding a "Save as..." button to it. It also handles the
# logic associated with the "Save as..." operation.
#
# Usage of this snit::type in a larger application is currently discouraged. It
# _should_ work fine as long as there is no other menu bar in the toplevel it is
# being embedded into. Should the user want to build a more complicated widget
# that manages no only the MDGG16 but other devices in a single Tk application,
# then it would be more appropriate to use this snit::type as a guide for how to
# assemble a functional application. they should just instantiate a new
# MDGG16View, MDGG16Presenter, and MDGG16Proxy of their own to add into their
# application.
#
snit::type MDGG16GuiApp {

  option -name -default {.view} ;#!< name to give view widget

  variable _menu ;#!< the main menu object

  component _options ;#! the option object
  component _proxy   ;#! the device handle  (probably an MDGG16Proxy)
  component _view    ;#! the main view
  component _presenter ;#! the presenter that controls the main view

  delegate option * to _options ;#!< All options should go to the 
                                ;#   MDGG16AppOptions

  # fatal and this will bail with a message.

  ## @brief Set the menu on the toplevel widget to be this.
  #
  # At the moment, this will just override any existing menu. This should be
  # fine unless other people are looking to embed this with other megawidgets.
  # In which case, they can just build it themselves from the MDGG16View and
  # MDGG16Presenter. This instance is probably not the correct thing to use.
  #
  # @todo support proper handling of an existing menu on the toplevel.
