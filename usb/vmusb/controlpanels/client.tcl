# This package provides a client to access the 
# readout's port for control operations.
#

package provide usbcontrolclient   1.0

package require snit
package require portAllocator

#
#  Snit type to connect with a controls client.
#  Construction implies connection, construction errors will
#  Typically imply that the server is not available.
#   
# Options and defaults:
#    -server  localhost    - The host to connect to.
#    -port    27000        - The connection port.
#  NOTE:  
#       All options can only be provided at construction time.. after that
#       they have no effect.
# Methods:
#    Get    device channel
#    Set    device channel value
#    Update device

    #      voltage value, current limit interlock state etc.
    #  Returns:

    #                begin ERROR mean a server detected error.
    #      Failure - Generally because the connection was dropped by the
    #                server e.g. Readout exited.

# @class slowControlsPrompter
#
# Snit megawidget that prompts for a control server.  The
# widget has the following format:
#
#  +-----------------------------------------------+
#  | +----------------------------+^|              |
#  | | list box of servers        | |              |
#  | +----------------------------+V|              |
#  | <hostname entry>   <port entry>               |
#  |                                               |
#  +-----------------------------------------------+
#  | [ Ok ]  [Update] [Default Port]  [Cancel]     |
#  +-----------------------------------------------+
#                                              
#  When started, the hostname is localhost and the port entry contains 27000
#  and the  list box, contains a list of advertised servers if any on localhost
#  The following buttons have autonomous action:
#
#  Update - Updates the list box of servers from the host in the hostname
#  entry (e.g. enter spdaq44 in hostname and click update to get a list of
#  advertised servers).
#  Default port -Loads 27000 (the default server port) into the port entry.
#
#  In addition, doubleclicking an item in the list box of servers, loads it into
#  the hostname/port entry (both the host name and the port are updated as the
#  user may have typed something into host without clicking update and then
#  double clicked a server.)
#
# OPTIONS:
#   -defaultport   - The default port number.
#   -host          - Sets/gets the hostname entry field.
#   -port          - Sets/gets the port entry field.
#   -okcmd         - Script executed on the OK button click.
#   -cancelcmd     - Script executed on the Cancel command click.
#   -type          - Type of service..shouild be VMUSBReadout or CCUSBReadout.
#
# METHODS:
#    update        - Forces an update of the listbox from the current values
#                    of -host.  Note this is done automatically by the constructor
#                    after configuration options have been processed.
#
# SUBSTITUTIONS:
#   %W           - The widget
#
# IMPLEMENTATION NOTE:
#   * We use a widget adaptor to allow the hull to be a ttk::frame
#   * where they exist we use ttk widgets.
#   * Methods whose names begin with _ should be considered private.
#     All other methods are public.
