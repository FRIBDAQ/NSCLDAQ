## @breif Client for the mdgg16 VMUSBReadout slow-controls module
#
# This is intended to work with the mdgg16 slow-controls module in the 
# VMUSBReadout. It therefore depends on the present of that server. 
#
# The interface currently provided is very minimal and can be added to if more
# functionality is required from the MDGG-16 device. At the moment there is
# only a desire to use it as a programmable OR.
#
# This owns a single component.
