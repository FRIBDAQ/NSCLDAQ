 *  The driver:
 *
 *   1.   It must be derived from a CControlHardware class.
 *   2.   It must define the following pure virtual methods:
 *        *   onAttach - Get access to the configuration and define configuration parameters.
 *        *   Update   - Update the hardware from internal settings.
 *        *   Set      - Make a setting.
 *        *   Get      - Return the value of a setting.
 *        *   clone    - Make a copy of this (virtual constructor)
 *   3. Optionally the driver can define Initialize
 *   4. See below for periodic monitoring.
 *
 *  Some devices need periodic monitoring.  For example, if you have a VME HV unit you need
 *  to be able to periodically poll for trips even during data taking.  This is done by defining
 *  the following methods:
 *  
 *   *  addMonitorList - Adds a set of VME operations to the list that polls for needed information.
 *   *  processMonitorList - Process the chunk of the data from the list that pertains to you.
 *   *  getMonitoredData   - Produce the most recent chunk of monitored data to clients.
 *
 * Monitor lists and their use will be described in the formal docs and won't be shown in this sample driver.
