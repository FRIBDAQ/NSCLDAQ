/**!
*   
*   This class is the backbone to the the branch driver 
*   infrastructure. It maintains a pointer to a CamacBranchDriver
*   and also the set of camac crates that live on the branch.
*   It calls the initialization routine for the branch and 
*   then for all of the crates that are registered to it. Furthermore,
*   it iterates through the registered crates and calls each
*   one's addReadoutList in the order it was called.
*
*   It is important to note that this does not know anything
*   about actual hardware besides the CVMUSB. It only knows
*   about abstract camac crates. The hardware must registered 
*   to the camac crates registered to this in order to be used.
*
*   At the moment this is specialized to the CBD8210. However,
*   it could be replaced by anything in the future that is 
*   based on the CCamacBranchDriver interface in the future.
