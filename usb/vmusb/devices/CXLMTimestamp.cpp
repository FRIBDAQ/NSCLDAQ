/**
 *  This file contains a template device driver for the CC-USB 
 * readout framework.  While these comments are no substitute
 * for the documentation available online at http://docs.nscl.msu.edu
 * The idea is that you will have to modify several sections of this code
 * Each section you need to modify is bracketed with comments of the form
 *  MODIFY ME HERE and
 *  END MODIFICATIONS
 *
 *  Comments above eac modification describe what you are doing and to some extent why.
 *
 * The final objective of this exercise is to produce a Tcl loadable package that you
 * can incorporate into the CC-USB readout framework via a load /some/path/to/yourpackage.so
 * command in your configuration file.
 *
 * As such each driver consists of two segments:
 * The main chunk is device driver code.  Device driver code 
 *
 * - Establishes configuration parameters and their constraints.
 * - Uses the values of those configuration parameters to initialize an instance of the device.
 * - Uses the values of the configuration parameters to contribute the CCUSB instructions required
 *   to read the device to the CC-USB readout list to which the module was assigned.
 *
 *  The second chunk is package initialization code. In that chunk, we need to make your driver
 *  known to the configuration subsystem, assigning it a Tcl command ensemble that can
 *  create, configure, and  query the configuration of instances of the driver.
 */


/*
 *  This template builds a driver class named XLMTimestamp  The first thing you should do
 *  is do a global search and replace fo XLMTimestamp to a name that matches the
 *  device you are trying to support.

 * MODIFY ME HERE

 *  END MODIFICATIONS>

 * This function is called when an instance of the driver has been associated with

 *
 *  You need to invoke methods from CConfigurableObject to create configuration parameters.
 *  by convention a configuration parameter starts with a -.  To illustrate this,
 *  template code will create a -base parameter that captures the base address of the module.
 *  In addition we'll create an -id parameter which will be the value of a marker that will
 *  be put in the event.  The marker value will be constrainted to be 16 bits wide.
