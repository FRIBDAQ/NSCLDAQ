 - Coded support for the SIS3804 scaler: funded by George Washington
   University.

Februrary 14, 2008
- Debugged support for the SIS3804 scaler.

April 16, 2008
- Don't allow linkage to nscldaq-9.0 it's not compatible.
- Fix error in router/COutputThread.cpp.  Was not inserting the run number into the buffer header
  for physics buffers. Others were ok.
May 8, 2008
  - Create a validator for floats in CConfigurableObject
  - Create convenience routines for getting integer, bools,
    floats from a config in CConfigurableObject
  - Support the hytec 2530 adc.
May 9, 2008
  - Add -requiredata boolean flag to C785 which controls the
    EMPTY_PROG bit in the BSet/BClear 2 registers.

May 14, 2008
   - Factored out some conversion functions to CConfigurableObject
   - Added support for Hytec NADC2530 list mode.
May 17, 2008
   - Added support for Mesytec MADC module.
   - Added command to configure in Mesytec MADC 32 modules.
July 29, 2009
   - Added support for variable length block reads to the VMUSB class library.
   - Modify the NADC software to:
     o Support zero supression
     o Use the List Mode Memory Address Counter LS and a variable length 
       block transfer to read the data from the module.

   -  >I< think the NADC read works correctly, but that the NADC does not.
August 20, 2009
   - Since the first NADC2530 read has a bunch of data stacked up due to the
     long startup time.. unless the deadtime logic is perfect,
     make the NADC2530 read 
     * length masked by 0x1f to limit to hopefully 1 event or less.
     * Make output data of the form -id value, followed by mask value
       followed by raw length followed by the data so this
       can all be mechanically decoded.
November 25, 2009
   - Emit begin run buffer only after the VM-USB is in acquisition mode.
January 8, 2010
   - Add a delay after each element of the MADC32 initialization list as that\
     seems to be needed now (firmware in MADC or VM-USB??).  Investigate
     those possibilities later.
January 28, 2010
   - Roll in fixes after working with Silvie and Mike from Indiana.
January 31, 2010
   - Use times with micro preceision.
March 23, 2010
   - Find Tcl from high to low not low to high.
3.2-008
May 19, 2010 - Adding support for CAEN V977 input register.

Nov 11, 2010 - Adding support for CAEN V965 multirange qdc.

Dec 2, 2010 - Fixed block transfer base address. had been getting block aligned.
December 10, 2010 - Added CHINP support (Wash-U Jon Elson).
                  - debugged remote VMUSB handling
3.6-001
	May 9, 2011  - Turn back on hinp command in daqconfig.
3.7 
   May 16, 2011 - Debugged support for slow controls monitor lists.

3.4
   -  Add support for continuous buffer mode from VM-USB into larger
      nscldaq homgenous buffers.	
   - Add readout support for the CAEN V1729 FADC module.
