7.1-005 3/31/03
    -  Allow Readout/Active.cpp Active::EndRun to be harmlessly called
       when the run is not in progress.

7.1-002-004 - 
	Fixed misc. problems with Stager and with ReadoutGui
        to make these more production quality.

7.1-001  2/11/03: 
  - ./configure.in  - Fix an error in the search for the SBS/Bit3 headers.
    the script would fail if the initial set of directories did not contain
    the headers...even if the secondary search set did.
  - VMEApi/Makefile.am
    VMEApi/SBSBIT3API.h  - this file was mis-named and should have been called
	SBSBit3API.h  (note difference in capitalization).  The file has been
        renamed and Makefile.am fixed up to produce an appropriate tarball.
  - Stager/directories.tcl - Modified to support a BUFFERSIZE environment
	variable that can be used to modify the behavior of 
	ExpFileSystem::GenRunFile in the event the user has overidden the 
	default daq buffersize

7.1-002 3/2/03:
-   Correct the name of the Vme API library.
-   No longer set the busy when scalers are being read as that can
    cause false triggers in the case where the user is using the busy
    as the trigger signal.

7.1-003 3/17/03
	ReadoutGUI defect fix:  If a link to the event file already exists 
	in the ~/experiment/current directory at the start of a recorded run, 
	the run start fails.  Fixed by removing such links if required.

	ReadoutGUI defect fix:  If readout is being recompiled as it runs, 
	ReadoutGUI can hang or readout can die.  Fixed by copying readout 
	program to 'private hidden' directory first.

	Added production readout software to the autoconf build, along with 
	its documentation.

7.1-004 3/23/03
	This release adds the SBS/Bit3 device driver to the build.  
	 SBS/Bit3 has kindly released the source code of this driver for 
	open distribution so long as redistribution includes acknowledgement 
	of the SBS Technologies copyright.

	From now on, it will be necessary to be root to build the system 
	in order to get the device driver properly installed.

	Changes:
	- Minor bug fixes.
	- SBS/Bit3 device driver included in the build.

7.1-005 3/31/03
    -  Allow Readout/Active.cpp Active::EndRun to be harmlessly called
       when the run is not in progress.

7.2    ??/??/??
    - Support multi-crate configurations of the CAENCard and CAENChain
      modules.
