##
# This file provides a run state machine callout bundle.
# When data sources are supposed to be active (when the state is other than
# NotReady or Starting), the data source manager
# is periodically polled for the states of all data sources.
#
# If any data source drops out:
#  *   A message is logged indicating this.
#  *   If the state is Active or Paused it is forced to the Halted state.
#  *   All data sources are stopped
#  *   The state is forced to NotReady.
#
#  This puts the system in a state where the data sources can be restarted
#  when either circumstances or fixes to the failing data source warrant.
