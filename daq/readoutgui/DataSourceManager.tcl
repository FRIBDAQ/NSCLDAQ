# @class
#   DataSourceManager
#
#  This class manages data source providers and provides mechanisms to
#  run them all together...that is it provides type methods that make it look
#  like a data source provider itself with the intersection of the capabilities
#  of all of the sources it is managing.
#
# TYPEMETHODS:
#   enumerateProviders - list the set of data sources.  These are the names of packages
#               that end in _Provider with the _Provider hacked off.
#
# METHODS:
#   load      - Load a data source provider into an instance of a data source
#               manager.
#   parameters - Get the parameterization of a data source provider.
#   capabilities - Get the capabilities of a data source provider.
#   systemCapabilities - Get the capabilities of the system.  This is the
#                        intersection of all capabilities of starte data sources.
#   addSource     - Start a data source.
#   check         - Check the liveness of all data sources.
#   stop          - Stop a single data source.
#   stopAll       - Stop all data sources.
#   begin         - Start a run in all data sources.
#   end           - end the run in all data sources.
#   pause         - Pause the run in all data sources.
#   resume        - Resume the run in all data sources.
