## @class RunProcessor
#
# @brief Manages the jobs in the list of jobs to be processed
#
# This maintains a JobProcessor instance that does the real heavy lifting.
# The purpose of this class really is to manage the list of jobs that need
# to be processed and iterate through them. For each job, the RunProcessor
# will configure the JobProcessor and set it into motion. At the same time,
# it maintains a list of observers that receive information about the 
# status of the job processing. These observers are alerted when a new
# run is begun, when a new job is started, when the run completes, and when
# run fails. 
#
# The RunProcessor handles a list of jobs in the form of a dict. The dict is 
# composed of keys reflecting the name of each job and those keys map to another
# dict whose keys and values are :
#   --inputparams         OfflineEVBInputPipeParams
#   --hoistparams         OfflineEVBHoistPipeParams
#   --evbparams           EVBC::AppOptions 
#   --outputparams        OfflineEVBOutputPipeParams
#
# The RunProcessor only knows how to start up jobs and has no idea how to determine
# whether the job has finished. It is actually the responsibility of the JobProcessor
# to tell the RunProcessor whether the job was completed. It then tells the RunProcessor
# to transition to the next job.
# 
# The JobProcessor actually runs on a separate thread of execution owned by this
# this. The management of that JobProcessor is made by sending it commands
# to the job processor via the thread::send command. There is no shared data
# between the main thread that the run processor lives in and the worker thread
# in which the JobProcessor runs.
