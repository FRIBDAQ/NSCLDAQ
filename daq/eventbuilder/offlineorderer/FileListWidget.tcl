## @brief A simple widget that allows the user to select files and populate a 
#   list
#
# It is implemented as a simple widget without the MVP paradigm. This was
# a choice mainly to just keep this as a simple widget that is embodied 
# in a single class.
#
snit::widget FileList {

  option -filelist  -default "" ; #< the list of files being managed
  option -sort      -default 1  ; #< whether or not to keep the list sorted
  

  variable m_nAlreadyAdded 0    ; #< a simple counter to ensure unique ids

  ## @brief Build the GUI

    $self configurelist $args

  ## @brief Handle presses of the "Add Files" button
  #
  # This launches a file selector dialogue and then adds the 
  # selection to the list of files. Optionally it will sort the 
  # list of files if options(-sort) is 1.

  ## @brief Inserts a list of files into the treeview widget 
  #
  # This will insert the files as new items to the end of the
  # the root node in the treeview. Each entry in the list will
  # receive a unique id. Only the tail will be displayed while the
  # value associated with it will be the absolute path.
  #
  method appendFiles {selection} {
    # insert the new files from the selection
    foreach f $selection {
      $win.list insert {} end -id file$m_nAlreadyAdded \

  ## @brief Reorder the displayed items in ascending order
  #
  method sortList {} {
    # order them

    set children [$win.list children {}]

    # remove them from view but don't delete them
    $win.list detach $children

    # create a dict of (file name:id) pairs
    set map [dict create]

    # new ordering
    foreach fname $fnames {
      $win.list move [dict get $map $fname] {} end
    }
  }

  ## @brief Remove the selected entries from the treeview
  # 
  # Note that removing files will not change the order
  # of the residual items. If they were ordered prior
  # to the deletion, then they will remain ordered after
  # it.
  #
  method onRemove {} {

  #
  method clearTree {} {

  }

  ## @brief Get the list of absolute paths in the treeview
  # 
  # This simply builds a list of the absolute paths held
  # by the treeview object. Note that the displayed values
  # are actually just the tail of the file name and that 
  # the -value option of the treeview items contains the 
  # absolute path. The order of the treeview widget will be
  # maintained.
  #
  # @returns a list of the absolute paths
