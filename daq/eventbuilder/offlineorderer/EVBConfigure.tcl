## This is a simple callout bundle that enable the user to set the 
#  build window to 600 seconds. WE need this for the offlineorderer
#  because we need to have a huge build window for safety.
#
#  I do not make this generic because it is really only useful for the
#  offline orderer. I cannot see a reason to make this generally usable.
