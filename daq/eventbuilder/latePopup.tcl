 ##
 # @class LateWindow
 #    This is a widget adaptor for a toplevel widget which displays
 #    data late statistics.   Normally this will be managed by
 #    a latePopup which will create it as needed when late statistics change.
 #
 #   On the whole this is pretty simple, we are a top level that contains the
 #   lateFragments widget..all methods get delegated to that widget.

 # @class LatePopup
 #    A class that manages a late popup.  For the most part it intercepts
 #    the calls/configurations for the lateFragments widget in an EVB::LateWindow.
 #    if the window does not exist, it is created before the option/command is
 #    relayed.
