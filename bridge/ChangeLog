This constitutes the initial release of bridge, software
that bridges the Spectrodaq and Spectrodaq-lite data distribution
systems.  This consists of two programs and a script:

spectrodaqToStdout - a spectrodaq client that sends all data to stdout
stdinToSpdaqLite   - a data source for spectrodaq-lite that copies fixed
                     sized (8192 byte) buffers to spectrodaq-lite's input
                     stream.
bridge             - A bash shell script that essentially does:
                     spectrodaqToStdout | stdinToSpdaqLite  to create the bridge.
