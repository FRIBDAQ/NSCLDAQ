     * @struct ReferenceCountedBuffer
     * @brief A reference-counted buffer with dynamic storage.
     * @details
     * The idea is that rather than doing data movement, pointers can be
     * registered with the buffer and unregistered. The buffer can then
     * be queried to determine if it can be released, or put in a free list.
     *
     * One feature of this buffer is that, if there are not references,
     * it can be resized. Since resizing is only legal if there are
     * no references, the contents of the buffer are not preserved across
     * a resize.
     *
     * The intended use for this data structure is to provide support for
     * zero copy operations in the DDAS Readout program. The idea is that
     * a block of data can be read from a digitizer into one of these and
     * then pointers to each hit created rather than performing copies into 
     * other data structures.
