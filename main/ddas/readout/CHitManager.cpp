 * addHits
 *    Adds hits from a set of modules.  The hits are sorted and then
 *    merged into the sorted hits.  I _think_ my big O analysis says that
 *    the fastest way to do this is to first sort each dequeue and then
 *    merge them using the minheap algorithm.  Those then get
 *    insertion merged into the main sorted hits deque.
 *
 *    Note that the merging is all done is private methods.
 *
 * @param newHits - this is a vetor of dequeues of hit information.
 *                  the idea is that each of the deques in the vector
 *                  is data from one module.  Note that maintaining
 *                  module separation makes the module sorting several
 *                  small sorts rather than, potentially one big sort
 *                  and I think that comes out ahead.
 * @note - the deques in the vector will be emptied.
 * @note - m_sortedHits will be extended by all the hits in the system.

/**
 * merge
 *   This overload merges a vector of sorted dequeues onto the back end of
 *   a dequeue.  The merge is done by using the method of min-heaps
 *   until only one dequeue has data at which point in time, all elements
 *   of that remaining queue are just appended to the output deque.
 *
 *   Complexity analysis  Suppose there are m dequeues in the input array
 *   and each of them has n/m elements where n is the total number of elements
 *   The insertions into the minheap are O(log(m)) and this has to be done
 *   n times for O(nlog(m)).  Since typically n << m all of this is much
 *   faster than the O(nLog(n)) required to just merge them all and sort them.
 *
 *   For a simple descriptino of minheap merging see e.g.
 *   https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/merge-k-sorted-linked-lists-set-2-using-min-heap/
 *
 * @param[out]  result    - The dequeue into which the elements will be put.
 * @param[inout] newHits  - Vector of input dequeues.  These will be emptied
 *                          by this method.
 * @note - this method assumes that on input at least one of the
 *         newHits deques has at least one element.
 * @note -currently we use an std::multimap for the minheap... that may require
 *        costly new/free's.  If that turns out to be the case, we can
 *        just do std::sort's on an std::vector of std::pair<double, dequeue*>
 *        Note that multimap must be used because there may be duplicate timestamps.

 *  This merge merges new hits into an existing sorted hits list.
 *  We assume that, other than when starting up, the time range covered by the
 *  output deque is much larger than that of the new hits (the window is
 *  seconds where at high rates, which is what we care about optimizing, the
 *  data read from a module will be milliseconds?).
 *
 *  Here are the cases:
 *  -  If the ouptut is empty, - just set the outut to the input.
 *  -  IF the last element of the output has a timestamp that's less than or
 *     equal to that of the front of the new hits, we can just append the new hits.
 *  - Otherwise, pull elements off the back of the existing deque into a temporary
 *    dequeue until the timestamp on the back of the existing dequeue is greater
 *    than that of the front of the new elements then use std::merge
 *    to merge the resulting dequeues into the end of the existing deque.
