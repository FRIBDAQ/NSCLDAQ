 * @class ZeroCopyHit
 * @brief This class extends RawChannel to produce a raw channel that is 
 * zero-copied from a reference counted buffer that comes from a buffer arena. 
 * This is a key data structure in the zero-copy DDAS readout.
 *
 * @details
 * This acts like a RawChannel, but on destruction, if it is the last reference
 * to the buffer, returns it to the arena from whence it came. 
 
 * Copy construction and assignment are supported with appropriate semantics 
 * to handle proper reference counting.
 *
 * I'm sure I'm hearing a pile of people ask me why not use 
 * std::shared_pointer -- The answer is that I don't actually want the buffers 
 * to be destroyed as that involves expensive dynamic memory management, I want
 * storage returned to a pre-allocated buffer arena from which it can be 
 * quickly re-gotten. Yeah I suppose I could use custom new/delete methods but 
 * that seems pretty painful and at least as error prone as this code.
