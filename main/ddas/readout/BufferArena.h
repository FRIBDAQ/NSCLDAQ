     * @details
     * Clients request storage of a specific size, and return it later.
     * The storage is provided as a reference counted buffer.
     *
     * Storage allocation strategy is relatively simplistic with the idea
     * that statistically, all storage managed by this object will wind up
     * eventually being resized to the biggest required block.
     *
     * This is suitable for I/O buffers but very wasteful for ordinary
     * storage management. The primary use case is for buffers for PXI readout.
