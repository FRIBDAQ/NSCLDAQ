/** \brief Converter for data formats : NSCLDAQ 10.2-00x
 *
 * A concrete implementation of the Converter base class to 
 * support the conversion of data built with NSCLDAQ versions 
 * 10.2-00x. This class expects a ring item whose ring-item-type
 * is PHYSICS_EVENT. These are composed of a set of EVBFragment-type
 * structures that surround the type of data . These structures 
 * have the following format
 *
 *  struct data_structure {
 *      uint32_t size_in_bytes
 *      uint64_t timestamp
 *      uint32_t source_id
 *      uint32_t payload_size (bytes)
 *      uint32_t barrier_type
 *      uint32_t pixie16_data[];
 *  }
 *
 * The Pixie-16 data format is defined by the Pixie-16 digitizer
 * module. It consists of a minimum of 4 32-bit words for the 
 * Pixie16 data header followed by any subsequent optional data.
 * The optional data may include trace data, energy sum data, or QDC
 * data. The ddaschannel class is solely responsible for interpreting
 * its structure. 
 *
 * The RootConverter2 object creates a branch in the tree referenced
 * by Converter::m_treepointer named ddasevent. It holds the DDASEvent objects
 * produced by every call to the RootConverter2::DumpData(const CRingItem&) 
 * method. DDASEvent objects are really arrays of individual ddaschannel
 * objects.
 *
