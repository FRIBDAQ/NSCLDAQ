/** \class Converter
 * \brief Base class for all converter objects
 *
 * This is an abstract class and cannot be instantiated. It provides the interface that must be
 * implemented by all derived classes. At the moment these are the RootConverter and
 * RootConverter2 classes. The BufdumpMain class only deals with the interface defined here
 * such that the use of different conversion objects in the ddasdumper program is transparent to
 * the remainder of the program. 

 * There is one pure virtual member, DumpData(const CRingItem&), that exists because there is no 
 * sensible default implementation. 
 *
 * This base class does not merely define an interface though, instead it provides some basic 
 * functionality that will promote consistency between output data of all concretely defined 
 * classes. The basic functionality defined by this class is the generation of the TFile 
 * that will be used to store the outputted data and also the TTree that contains the converted
 * data. The actual structure of the TTree is not defined here and its definition is left as a 
 * responsibility derived classes.
