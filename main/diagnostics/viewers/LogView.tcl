# @class LogView
#    Provides a view of log messages.  This is just a pretty dumb displayer
#    -  It's a scrolling treeview.
#    -  It provides a method to clear all treeview entries.
#    -  It provides a method to load a bunch of messages into the tree view.
#    -  It provides a method to add a message to the tree view.
#
#  Filtering is done by the controller (LogController in the MVC triad) in
#  conjunction with the filtering capabilities of the model (LogModel).
#
# OPTIONS
#    -colors - specifies the colors that various severity types are given.
#              this is of the form [dict create sev color ...]
#              The default foreground color of each entry is the foreground color
#              of the style.  Note that changes are dynamic.
