# @class RunstateMachine
#
#    This snit object provides a run state machine for the readoutGUI
#    The statemachine relies on action callouts that are called when
#    entering an leaving states.  Callouts are managed as 'bundles'  which are
#    basically namespaces with well defined commands exported.
#    These commands are:
#      *  enter  - Called when entering a state, passed the old state, newstate
#      *  leave  - Called when leaving a state, passed the old state, new state.
#      *  attach - Called when added to the callouts list.  Passed the
#                  current state.
#
#    It is up gto the client to ensure the namespaces registered exist.
#    Note that a side effect of registration is to create a namespace
#    ensemble out of the namespace.
#
# States are:
#    *  NotReady - No data sources are active.
#    *  Starting - The data sources are now being started.
#    *  Halted   - Data sources are active, but the run is not.
#    *  Active   - Data taking is in progress.
#    *  Paused   - Data taking is paused.
#
#  All state transitions are triggered by the transition method.
#  Legality of transitions are checked against the state machine definition
#  and errors thrown if an illegal transition is attempted.
#
# METHODS

#
#  daqdev/NSCLDAQ#659 - We keep track of the successful bundle calls and, if one
#                       fails we call the optional method failed in the successful
#                       bundles.
#
#  Any methods that start with _ are considered private.  Note that
#
#   _setState  will be used by the tests to force the state machine to a
#              specific state prior to a test.  This method does not invoke
#              any bundle methods, nor does it check the legality of the state
#              transition being forced.

    # have been detected as a list of lists. Each element of the list is a 
    # list with the first element being the name of the callout bundle and the 
    # second element being the error message. In other words, if two callout
    # bundles, e.g. bundle0 and bundle1, report errors the result might be:
    #  
    #  [list bundle0 {error found in bundle0} [list bundle1 {error for bundle1}]]
    #
    # Callout bundles that do not use implement this bundle are simply ignored. On
    # the other handle, a callout bundle that implements this must provide a proc
    # in its namespace that has the following signature:
    #
    # @code
    # proc ::BundleName::precheckTransitionForErrors {from to} {
    #   # code for bundle
    # }
    # @endcode
    #
    # @param to   state to transition to
    # @returns list of detected problems.

    #  retains compatibility with nscldaq 11 etc.
