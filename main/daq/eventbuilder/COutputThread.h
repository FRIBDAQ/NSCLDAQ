/**
 * @class COutputThread
 *     This thread is responsible for handling the output observers for the
 *     event ordering stage of the event builder.  The thread contains
 *     a thread safe queue of pointers to vectors of ordered fragments
 *     and an ordered list of observers.  A mutex protects the list of observers.
 *     The queue has its own mutex/condition variable.
 *
 *     The action of the thread is to get vectors of fragments fromt its thread
 *     safe queue and pass them on to the ordered lists of observers.  Each observer
 *     does as it will with the fragments.   A separate thread is used for two
 *     reasons:
 *      -  Theoretically on a multicore system we can improve performance by
 *         pipelining fragment sorting with fragment outupt.
 *      -  More importantly, without this thread we observed (see Bug #6079) that
 *         flow control on the output would block user interface updates which,
 *         in turn, would mislead the user about how the event builder was
 *         performing.
