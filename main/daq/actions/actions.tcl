# actions.tcl
#
# A tcl package to handle the parsing of a basic messaging protocol
# to allow communication between devices in a pipeline and the ReadoutGUI.
#
# Things that need to be fixed. 
#   - Need to fix the leaking of the process.
#   - sometimes a newline is prepended to an output and that needs to be 
#     fixed.

## 
#  A TCL-side parser for reading messages out of a pipeline enabled
#  for reading. This aims to handle messages that are bookended with
#  newline characters and will not work properly if messages do not
#  follow that rule. Within that framework, this will identify 
#  packets that are formed by the C++ functions in the Actions namespace.
#  These have the form "DIRECTIVE size message", where DIRECTIVE is either
#  ERRMSG, LOGMSG, WRNMSG, TCLCMD, OUTPUT, or DBGMSG. Any other message 
#  that is not in this form will be treated as output.
#
#  This snit::type only handles the parsing stage of the message handling.
#  What is actually done with the messages after parsing is entirely up
#  to the user and definable via a callback bundle (-actionbundle). By 
#  default, a callback bundle is provided and used that will work with
#  the ReadoutGUI logging mechanism for formatting data.

  ## Adjust the number of lines we have to process

  # We need to be careful about not processing the last line of the message
  # in case it did not end in a newline character. By not ending in a newline
  # character, that means we do not have a complete message and should
  # adjust the number of lines to process so that the last line is excluded.

  ## The logic for parsing the messages
  #
  # This has become embarrassingly complicated... but it is not reasonable to rewrite.
  # Parsing is not a trivial task.
  #
  # The idea here is that we are maintaining a list of lines that were separated by 
  # newline characters. Packets may be contained in a single line or may consist of multiple lines.
  # The packet message that is being formed is therefore part of the state of the 
  # snit::type and is appended to until it is determined complete. 
  #
  # Once a packet is completed, it is added to a list of results. You can imagine that the 
  # possibility exists to have multiple packets to deal with if we are not line buffering.
  # In that case, we keep adding complete packets to our list until all viable text has
  # been processed and then the packets are processed at the end.
