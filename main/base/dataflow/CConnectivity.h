/**
 * CConnectivity
 *   This class provides a mechanism to determine which hosts
 *   get or put data into a specified host.  It does this
 *   by examining the ringbuffers in that system.  
 *      Ringbuffers named something@something.else represent 
 *   proxy rings that indicate the system is getting data 
 *   from the ring 'something' located in the host something.else.
 *     Ringbuffers that have a consumer that looks like
 *   ringtostdout that also have a parameter indicate data being
 *   sent from that ring to the host indicated by the parameter.
 * 
 *   Note that we need help to look up the command associated
 *   with a ring buffer's clients.  The ringmaster has been
 *   modified to support that with the CLIENTS operation.
 *
 *  *  getProducers therefore gets the hosts that produce data into
 *     this node.
