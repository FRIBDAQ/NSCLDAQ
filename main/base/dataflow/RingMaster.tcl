#
#  This script manages membership in all the ring buffers. It is responsible
#  for detecting the exit of clients.
#
#  The protocol is very simple ring clients connect and maintain a connection for
#  the life of their execution.  Clients only intereseted in info need not maintain
#  the connection.
# 
#  Once connected the following commands are understood:
#
#   CONNECT ringname connecttype pid comment
#     Indicates the client has connected to the ring 'ringname' with a connection type
#     connecttype that is either 'producer' or 'consumer'.  The client's pid is
#     provided as well as a descriptive comment.
#
#   DISCONNECT ringname connecttype pid
#     Indicates a 'clean' disconnect from a ring. This is done by a destruction of a 
#     CRingBuffer object that was created for the connection. 
#
#   LIST
#
#     Lists information about the ring usage.
#  REGISTER ring
#     Reports the creation of a new ring.
#  UNREGISTER ring
#     Reports the deletion of an existing ring.
#  REMOTE ring
#     Requests ring from the data to be hoisted via a socket.
#
#  On success, CONNECT and DISCONNECT reply with
#    "OK\n"
#   to the caller.
#  LIST replies with
#     "OK\n"
#  Followed by ring usage as described later.
#
#
#   CONNECT and DISCONNECT are only allowed on sockets that are connected from localhost.
#   LIST is allowed from any connection.
#
#  Errors in the protocol close the socket.
#
#  If a socket close is detected, the server releases all un-disconnected ring buffer pointers
#  still owned by the client.
