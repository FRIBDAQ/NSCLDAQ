/**
 * @class CPagedOutput
 *    Outputs data to a file using page mapped I/O.  The idea is that
 *    we hold a region mapped to a file.  We plop data into it and
 *    the munmap actually flushes that data out to file.
 *    We use ftruncate to extend the file as needed.  Our buffersize
 *    is the number of pages of memory that can acccomodate the requested
 *    buffer size.
 *    -  When the file is closed, the file is truncated to the number of bytes
 *    actually written.
 *    -  flush results in an msync which ensures the data are transferred to disk.
 *
 *
 *   @note - programs that access the file while it's being written must
 *           be written to understand that there may be pages in the file
 *           that don't have valid data yet.  Those pages will, in general,
 *           be filled with zeroes as that's what ftruncate does when you
 *           expand a file.
