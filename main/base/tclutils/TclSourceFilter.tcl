## @brief Extracts specific patterns from a script
#
# This snit::type can be loaded with a list of regular expressions that are used
# to extract full blocks from a tcl script. This takes the original script,
# breaks it into complete blocks, and then checks those blocks against the
# specified patterns. 
#
# Any pattern provided is used in conjunction with the regexp command.

  # it has found a positive match or has run out of regular expressions to try.
