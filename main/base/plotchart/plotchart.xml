    <title>Plotchart</title>
    <para>
        Plotchart is a pure Tcl data plotting package.  It is used by several
        Tcl components of NSCLDAQ (e.g. the scaler display program) to produce
        graphs.  The author of Plotchart is Arjen Markus of Deltares in the
        Netherlands.  The NSCL Scientific software development team have worked
        with Arjen to incorporate changes and suggested changes to make plotchart
        somewhat more suitable for use at the NSCL.

        As our version of plotchart has experimental features that have not
        yet made it back inot the normal Plotchart releases, the version at
        NSCL has been labeled 3.0.0 to ensure that it is selected preferentially
        over any system installed version (assuming
        <filename>$DAQROOT/TclLibs</filename> is in the package search path)
        unless you explictly select another version.
        For example, to select the version on Debian wheezy:

    <informalexample>
        <programlisting>
package require Plotchart 1.6
        </programlisting>
    </informalexample>
