    <title>CAEN Firmware loaders</title>
    <para>
        CAEN provides graphical and command line tools that load firmware into
        the FPGAs in their devices.  NSCLDAQ includes ports of the command line
        tool to both the SBS and VME VME controllers.
        These tools allow users to update fimrware as well as to install
        license keys into boards that will hold licensed firmware.

        <title>Parameter files</title>
        <para>
            CAEN devices vary somewhat in how they are programmed.  CAEN
            uses parameter files to describe to the firmware loader how
            each devide operates.  These files (or at least those available
            at the time NSCLDAQ was packaged) are installed in
            <filename>$DAQROOT/etc/caenfw</filename> where
            <filename>$DAQROOT</filename> is the top level directory of your
            NSCLDAQ installation.
