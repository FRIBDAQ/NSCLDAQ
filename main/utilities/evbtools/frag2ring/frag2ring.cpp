/**
 * @file frag2ring.cpp
 * @brief Filter to turn event fragments into EVB_FRAGMENT ring buffer elements.
 *
 *  This is a filter. stdin accepts data that is in the output format of the
 *  event orderer.  Speicifcally stdin is a sequence of EVB:: FragmentHeader
 *  structs followed by the payload associated with those structs (see
 *  fragment.h
 *
 *  stdout is a series of EventBuilderFragment structs with s_body appropriately
 *  sized as defined by the payload size of the corresponding input fragment.
 *  furthermore, s_header.s_type is EVB_FRAGMENT
 *
 *  No command options are required/defined for this code.
