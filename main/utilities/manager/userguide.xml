   <title>NSCLDAQ Manager subsystem (new in 12.0)</title>
   <para>
    As the FRIB begins operating, security concerns are moving the laboratory
    away from employing a single experiment account from which an experiment is
    run.  Instead, with the NSCLDAQ manager subystem, the persistent software
    in an experiment can be run by a single account but controlled by
    users logged in to
    accounts.
