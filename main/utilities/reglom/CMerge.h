/**
 * CMerge  This class does a merge sort on the data in the data sources.
 * Data are then output to the file descriptor that's passsed in.  This
 * results in a totally ordered data stream which $DAQBIN/glom can then build
 * into events on the other end.
 *
 * Note that we support two barrier types.  Begin run (barrier type 1)
 * and End run (barrier type 2).
 *
 * The data sources are assumed  to be complete runs.  If necessary,
 * the raw event files fed to unglom can be contanated together to ensure this.
 * Thus we require:
 *     - Each source file starts with a begin run item.
 *     - Each source file ends with an end run item.
 *
 * That makes barrier synchronization simple.  We sync at the start and hold
 * the end file items until all sources have one buffered up.
 *
 * If we have a begin without one, we complain.
 * If we have an end without one, we complain.
 *
 * None of those are fatal:
 * Missing begin, we just output the begins we have.
 * Missing ends,  we just output the ends we have.
