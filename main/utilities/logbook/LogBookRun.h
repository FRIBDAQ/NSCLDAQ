/**
 * @class LogBookRun
 *   A logBookRun object encapsulates the entire history
 *   of a run and its state transitions.  Note that
 *   notes by users are not part of this class. That's
 *   something that's handled by the LogBookNote class.
 *
 *   At the top level, a run has, in addition to its primary
 *   key a run number and a title. Attached to that run
 *   are transitions.  When a run is created a Begin run transition
 *   is automatically added. Therefore, the static 'begin' method
 *   is what is used to create a new run (rather than the more normal
 *   create method).  Once begun the run becomes the current run
 *   and remains so until the run is ended either by an emergency end
 *   or by a normal end operation.  In addition to all of this there
 *   are helper tables that provide the set of transition arcs and,
 *   given the last arc (which defines the current state) which
 *   subsequent arcs are allowed (e.g. defines a finite state
 *   machines for the runs).
 *   To recap, the set of tables directly used by runs are:
 *
 *   *   run   - The runs
 *   *   run_transitions - the history of state transition arcs
 *                         for each run.
 *   *   valid_transitions - The Text to transition id lookup
 *                         table that defines all state transition
 *                         arcs.
 *   *   valid_state_transitions -the table that defines, for
 *                       each last arc the valid subsequent arcs
 *    *  current_run - documents which run is active.
 *    
 *    Runs also document which shift was active for each state transition
 *    and, as such, use the current_shift table.  Note that
 *    if there is no current shift transitions are illegal.
