#  This can be used in one of two ways:
#
#  $DAQBIN/lg_selshift shiftname - selects that shfit as current.
#  $DAQBIN/lg_selfshift    - brings up a persistent GUI that lets you select
#                            the current shift, and displays the current shift
#                            and its members.
