/**
 * @class TclNoteInstnace
 *    This class wraps a LogBookNote instance in a Tcl command ensemble.
 *    The ensemble has the following subcommands:
 *
 *    -  id      - Returns the id of the note.
 *    -  run     - Returns a run command or "" for the associated run.
 *    -  author  - Returns an author encapsulated command.
 *    -  timestamp - returns a [clock seconds] at which the note was created.
 *    -  contents - the raw note contents.  This is assumed to be in Markdown format
 *    -  images  - Returns a possibily empty list of dicts.  Each dics
 *                 describes on image included in the Markdown note text See
 *                 Image Dictionaries below for more.
 *    -  substituteImages - returns the note text with:
 *                 * Any images extracted to temporary files.
 *                 * Any image references fixed up so that the links will work
 *                   to include the image inline.
 *
 *    Image Dictionaries
 *       Each image dscribed by the images subcommandis a dict with the following
 *       key/value pairs:
 *
 *       -  offset - the byte offset into the note at which its link to this
 *                   image begins.
 *       -  originalFilename - the original filename of the image.
 *       -  imageLength      - Number of bytes of image data.
 *       -  imageData  - Binary object containing the image data.  This, given
 *                       knowledge of the image type can be used to convert
 *                       the image into an actual Tcl photo presumably.
