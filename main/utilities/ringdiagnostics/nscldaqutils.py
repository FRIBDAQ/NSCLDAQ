        Performs an ssh command in the current environment

        *  The user must have set up passwordless ssh -> host.
          Their shell must be bash or some other sh compatible shell.

           -  The environemt we run under.
           -  Our current working directory.
           
        Parameters:
            host - host in which the command will run. 
            command - the command to run.
