/**
 * @class CMPIFanoutTransport
 *    This class is the sender  transport for a fanout.
 *    It pairs with CMPIFanoutClientTransport which receives data.
 *    Each client requests a work item from this transport by
 *    sending an empty message with the dataRequestTag tag.
 *    - Receive operations throw an exception.
 *    - Send operations receive a data request and then respond
 *      to the requesting rank with the work item provided.
 *    - End operations again wait for data requests and send end
 *      messages until there are no more requestors.
 *
 *  @note CMPIFanoutClientTransport must use the same communicator
 *        as the paired CMPIFanoutTransport.
 *  @note as requests come for data they are registered in this
 *        class's client registry.
 *  @note the end code is crafted so that if a data request
 *        comes from a client that has not yet registered,
 *        it's still sent an end.  This allows for the case
 *        when the data set is smaller than the number of
 *        clients e.g.
 *   @note ranks within the communicator are used to identify clients not some
 *        client id set by the client transport.
 *
