/**
 * @class CBuiltItemWorker
 *   We have a few utiltities that, in some way, operate on event built
 *   items.   These all have some common features in their process()
 *   method:
 *   - The need to know how many fragments there are in the event.
 *   - The need to iterate over those fragments.
 *
 *   This is a base class for those parallel workers that just extends
 *   CParallelWorker by adding those common  methods.
