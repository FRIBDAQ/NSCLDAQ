/**
 * @class CZMQThreadedClassifierApp
 *     This is a concrete class that uses ZMQ for communications and
 *     threaded parallelism that runs inside a specific system.  To make
 *     use of this class th euser must have created configuration files that define
 *     inproc URIs for:
 *     1   - The router of work items to  worker threads.
 *     2   - The push/pull fan-in from workers to timestamp sorter thread.
 *     3   - The push-pull one-to-one from sorter thread to the output thread.
 *
 *  With one worker, the application still has a pipeline parallelism of:
 *     data source -> worker -> timestamp-sortgin -> outputting
 *
 *  Though the sort thread won't need to do much as its data will come in sorted.
 *  Multiple workers simply fanout as a ROUTER/DEALER from source to workers and
 *  fan in using PUSH/PULL from workers to the timestamp sorter then pipeline
 *  parallelism again to the output thread.
