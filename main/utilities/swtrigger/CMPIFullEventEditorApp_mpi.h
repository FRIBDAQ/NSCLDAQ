/**
 * @class CMPIFullEditorApp
 *    This class provides an application class for the full event editor
 *    using MPI transport.  In MPI transport, each processin element is a
 *    process with a distinct address space.   MPI uses cluster communication
 *    services as configured by the cluster managers to communicate
 *    betweeen processes.
 *      Each process has a rank which is an integer value. The ranks are
 *    used to identify communication targets.  In our case, the rank also
 *    determines the function of the process within the application:
 *
 *    *  Rank 0 - Is the data source fanout to the workers.
 *    *  Rank 1 - Is the time-stamp resorter.
 *    *  Rank 2 - Is the event sink to the output file (typically we can't
 *                output to a ringbuffer in a cluster).
 *    *  All other ranks are workers.
 *
 * This implies that the value for -np on mpirun  must be at least 4 to allow
 * for one worker.  Note that the value for --workers is a register of intent
 * rather than actually used:
 *   *  IF -np is < 4, the application aborts.
 *   *  If -np is --nworkers + 3 all is good.
 *   *  If -np is not --nworkers + 3 but is > 4 a message is output indicating
 *      that there's an inconsistency between -np and --workers and that the
 *      number of workers implied by -np is overiding the value of --workers.
 *      and the application continues with -np - 3 workers.
