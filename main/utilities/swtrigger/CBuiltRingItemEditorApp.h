/**
 * @class  CBuiltRingItemEditorApp
 *    This is the base class for application level code for the
 *    ring item editor application.  Having a base and derived classes
 *    allows us to have specific application classes for various communication
 *    transports and patterns.  For example a ZMQThreaded might setup the
 *    classes to support threaded parallelism and ZMQ communication while an
 *    MPI class might do the same for MPI process parallelism and MPI
 *    communication.
 *
 *    This is the mechanism we have to implement the --parallel-strategy
 *    option in the program options.
