# @brief  Manage system services/servers based on db.
# @author <fox@nscl.msu.edu>


##
# Usage:
#    python svcmanager dbFile
#
#  dbName - the path to the database file.
#
#  Accepts the following commands at the prompt:
#    *  start  - Starts the services defined by the database.
#    *  stop   - stops the services that are currently being run.
#    *  exit   - Exit the program.
#
# @note - end of file on input is the same as exit.
