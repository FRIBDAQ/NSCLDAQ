/*!
  This class encapsulates the problem of creating run and state variable events.
  There are two issues.  The first is the simple one of creating those events.
  That's done by encapsulating the CDocumentedVars object so that there's access
  to the methods that return variable name/value pairs.

  The more interesting problem is that the thread that wants to produce a
  variable event may be different from the thread that runs the interpreter that
  maintains them.  If so some fancy footwork involving the event loop is required
  so that the Tcl apartment threading model is not violated:
  - Members are provided to 'trigger' these events.
  - If the trigger is done in a thread other than the one that created this object,
    an event is queued to the creating thread and we block on a condition variable.
    The guy that then makes the event will fire the condition variable when done
    so that the whole process looks synchronous to the trigger thread.
  - If the trigger is done in the same thread, we're just going to call the guy
    that makes the event.. which is inherently synchronous.
  - Finally, the condition thread's mutex is used to monitor access to the 
    trigger event...though the application is structured to prevent that anyway.

  This class makes use of a modified singleton pattern as well.  The constructor is 
  still public, however there is a static instance variable, and the
  constructor throws an exception if that's non-null.  There's a static function
  that will return the instance variable so the object can be located externally
  (e.g. by the objects involved in the trigger thread).
