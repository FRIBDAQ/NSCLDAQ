// Forward declaration of CControlModuleT
template<class Ctlr> class CControlModuleT;

/*!
   CControlHardwareT is an abstract base class for programmable electronics that is
   not read out as part of the event stream.  It provides a set of interfaces
   that the TclServer commands can use to communicate with a module.
   It also defines the configuration parameters the module can accept.
   The tacit assumption here is that modules only need to be initialized by
   'setting' controllable parameters.  If other initialization is required,
   it will be necessary for the module itself to maintain sufficient state to ensure
   that this happens at the first access, as presumably by then the configuration is
   initialized.

   The template parameter Ctlr is expected to be either CVMUSB or CCCUSB. 
   However, it is possible for any other type that provides the requisite 
   functionality to be used.
   
   Make the distinction between:
   - Configuration: Mostly static information used to access the module.
     for most devices this will consist solely of the base address.
   - Parameters: Control points within the device that are dynamically modified.
     For example for the GDG a parameter might be a channel delay.
