/**
 * controlTransfer
 *    Control transfers are normally used at USB device setup
 *    time.   Endpoint 0 is always used for control transfers.
 *    As such in libusb the term "setup packet" is often used to
 *    describe the fields of a control transfer.
 *    For what it's worth a setup packet is described in:
 *    https://www.beyondlogic.org/usbnutshell/usb6.shtml
 *
 *  @param reqType - the request type field for the packet.
 *  @param request - The request field for the packet.
 *  @param wValue  - the value field for the packet.
 *  @param windex  - the packet's index field.
 *  @param data    - Buffer into which data will be read for
 *                   transfers from the device and from which data
 *                   will be written in transfers to the device.
 * @param transferred - receives the actual number of bytes transferred.
 * @param msTimeout- Maximum number of milliseconds the
 *                   method blocks for the transfer.
 * @return int -   Number of bytes transferred but:
 * @retval <0  -   The transfer timed out.
 * @throw USBException - for all abnormal completions other than a timeout
 * @note Since there's no way to get the actual transfer count
 *       in the case of a timeout, we have to assume the transfers
 *       are an all or nothing thing.

/**
 * bulkTransfer
 *   Performs a bulk transfer operation.  This is the core of

 *
 * @param endpoint - The device endpoint for the transfer. This
 *                   also determines the direction of transfer.
 *                   If the top bit is set, this is a write otherwise
 *                   this is a read.  There are only 16 endpoints,
 *                   endpoint 0 is used for control operations.
 *                   The endpoints numbered 1-15 transfer data to
 *                   the host (reads) while those numbered
 *                   0x81-0x8f transfer data to the device (writes).
 * @param pData  - Pointer to the data to transfer.
 * @param dLength - Length of data to transfer;  For reads, this
 *                  is the amount of data pData can accomodate
 *                  while for writes, the number of bytes we want
 *                  to transfer.
 * @param[out] transferred - Returns the actual number of bytes
 *                  transferred.
 * @param msTimeout - Maximum number of milliseconds to allow the
 *                   transfer to take place.
 * @return 0 on succes, LIBUSB_ERROR_TIMEOUT on timeout.  See the note below.
 * @throw USBException on error.
 * @note The value of transferred should be checked for any read operation
 *       to determine how many bytes of data were actually received.
 *       If the operation completed with a timeout for either a
 *       read or write it's possible there was a partial transnfer
 *       prior to the timeout and the value of transferred should
 *       be examined to see where in pDta, dLength to continue the
