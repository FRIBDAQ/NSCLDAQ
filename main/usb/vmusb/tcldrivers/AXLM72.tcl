# @note   This is a heavily modified version of the original AXLM72 class
#         that was written by Daniel Bazin. It has been gutted to use
#         the cvmusb::CVMUSB and cvmusbreadoutlist::CVMUSBReadout methods
#         and to have a format that is more in line with other NSCLDAQ 
#         code.

# @class AXLM72
#
# This is the IncrTcl base class for all XLM72* modules. It provides
# a large number of convenience functions that derived classes can use
# in their drivers. The XLM72* family of devices are general purpose
# logic modules that have no real function independent of the firmware
# loaded onto them. For this reason, derived classed typically handle
# how to interact with devices that are running a specific firmware.
