/**
 * @file sampleDrivers.cpp
 * @brief Sample driver for CCUSB Slow controls sytsem.
 */


/**
 * Slow control drivers are divided into three sections:
 * 1. The driver code itself.  This is responsible for
 *    initializing the device and processing client requests.
 * 2. The object creator which is resopnsible for knowing how to create
 *    instances of a driver class.
 * 3. Initialization which is responsible for registering the driver 
 *    with the module factor which is what makes its type known to the
 *    Module command.
 */


/**
 * 1. The driver code:
 *
 *  Drivers must implement the following entry points:
 *  -    Construction and base class initialzation.
 *  -    OnAttach - Configuration parameter declaration.
 *  -    Update - Update driver state from shadow reegister sets.
 *  -    Set    - Set a device paramter to  a new value.
 *  -    Get    - Retrive the value of a device paramter to the client.
 *  -    clone  - Copy some other object into our state (virtual copy construtor).
