  the high water mark for waiters.  Note that there are two ways that
  a client may block:
  - When attempting to do a get, if there are no buffers, the caller will
    automatically block until either the buffer load in the queue is
    above m_nWakeLevel or wake is called.
  - The client decides to wait for buffers via wait().  In this case,
    the client blocks until at least m_nWakeLevel buffers are present and
    then is given the entire queue contents.

   Queue blocking operates on the basis of a low watermark called the

   0 will wake on all insertions an entry.  This scheme allows the user
   to implement an amortized queue where the dequeueing thread waits empties
   the list and then does a wait() before doing the next get.

   Waits for the next wake().  Note that in cases where there is more than

   will be elements in the queue on return from this function.  
   Suppose there are two threads a and b, and both of them issue a wait().
   when wake happens, if only one processor is avaiable, say thread gets scheduled
   and then does a getall() emptying the queue.  If thread b is not scheduled
   prior to the next queue then it will run but the queue will be empty.

   So the only gaurentee you have on exit is that at some point the wake
   level was exceeded. Note that to deal with this, the get member does
   something like:
\verbatim
Enter();
while (m_queue.empty()) {
