 <!-- 
    server:debug sets the server debug level.  Does not affect the
    debugging of user programs and will likely slow the server down.

    server:worldaccess if true, allows any user access to the SpectroDAQ
    server shared memory segments.

<server debug="0" worldaccess="true">

    url:sdaq-buff URL used by the clients to request data buffers from
    the SpectroDAQ server.
 -->
 <url name="sdaq-buff" proto="unix" host="localhost" port="service" path="/" /> 

 <!-- 
    url:sdaq-stat URL used to request servicer status information 
    (such as what threads are running within the SpectroDAQ server.
 -->
 <url name="sdaq-stat" proto="tcp" host="localhost" port="service" path="/" /> 

 <!-- 
    url:sdaq-link URL for requesting links between servers.  The URL
    is used for server-to-server communication and should not be
    used by user programs.
 -->
 <url name="sdaq-link" proto="tcp" host="localhost" port="service" path="/" /> 

 <!-- 
    url:sdaq-sink URL for requesting a data sink from the SpectroDAQ
    server.  Data sinks allow user programs to receive tagged data buffers
    from other where.  The addition of a sink results in the addition of
    a link between servers and a connection between a user program and
    the local server.
 -->
 <url name="sdaq-sink" proto="unix" host="localhost" port="service" path="/" /> 

 <!-- 
    param:pager:datasize is the data size of a page's data section in 
    kilobytes.  That is, a page can contain the specified number of
    kilobytes of user data.  IMPORTANT, both sending and receiving
    servers should be using the same datasize. 

    param:pager:shmsize is the size of the pager's shared memory segment 
    is megabytes.  The operating system needs to be set such that it
    can handle the requested number of megabytes of shared memory in
    addition to setting this parameter.  Also, SpectroDAQ will round
    down the the size of the shared memory segment such that it accomodates
    full sized pages (i.e., no partial pages).
 -->
 <param name="pager" datasize="8" shmsize="16" />

 <!-- 
    param:cycle:schedpages sets the maximum number of pages scheduled by
    the thread manager during each cycle.  Note, the thread manager
    may schedule more pages if necessary to guarantee entire buffers
    are scheduled for transmission.
 -->
 <param name="cycle" schedpages="48" />

 <!-- 
    param:localcache:multiplier sets the value by which to multiply
    a client's request for pages.  The additional pages are then
    cached locally to service later requests.  Care should be taken
    to not specify a multiplier so large that the request cannot be
    serviced by the server (i.e., request more pages than the size
    of the page pool, or such that other client's cannot be 
    serviced).
 -->
 <param name="localcache" multiplier="1" />
