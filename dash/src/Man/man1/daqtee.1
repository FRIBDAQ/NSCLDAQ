.SH NAME
daqtee \- manual page for daqtee 1.82
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B daqtee
[\fI--packet=PACKETS\fR] ... [\fIOPTION\fR]... \fIPROGRAM\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
Daqtee writes records from a DAQ experiment to two separate
programs enabling online filtering and data processing while
retaining the unfiltered or processed data.  Records written
to the secondary (tee) data stream can be selected a priori
using the \fB\-\-packet\fR flag.  That is, daqtee considers each record
read from standard input.  If the record's packet type matches
one of the specified packet types, then the record will be written
to the tee data stream.  All records read from stdin are
unconditionally written to the main data stream on stdout.
If the \fB\-\-packet\fR flag is not specified, then all records read from
stdin are also written to the tee data stream.
.PP
Packet types can be specified as either a single positive integer,
a range of positive integers or by using one of the known symbolic
names for some well known packet types.  Currently, the list
of symbolic well known packet types includes: Physics (a.k.a, Data),
Scaler, SnapSc, StateVar, RunVar, PktDoc and ParamDescript.
.PP
The essential characteristics of daqtee are as follows:
.PP
1. daqtee passes all records read on stdin to stdout.
.PP
2. daqtee runs a client program with stdin connected to a pipe
.IP
to which it write a copy of the records specified using the
\fB\-\-packet\fR flag.  If, the \fB\-\-packet\fR flag is not specified then
a copy of all the records received on stdin will be written
to the pipe.
.PP
3. If PROGRAM breaks the pipe, daqtee degenerates to writing
.IP
all records read on stdin to stdout.
.PP
4. If an eof is received on stdin, daqtee exits.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-\-version\fR
Output version information and exit
.TP
\fB\-\-help\fR
Display this help and exit
.TP
\fB\-\-debug\fR=\fISECONDS\fR
Output a debugging command and wait SECONDS
before beginning execution of main loop
.TP
\fB\-\-packet\fR=\fIPACKETS\fR
If more than one occurrence of this flag appears
on the command line, all packets and ranges
specified will be considered.  PACKETS can
be either a single positive integer, a range of
positive integers (e.g., 101\-118 or 101,118) or
a symbolic name (e.g., Physics).  All ranges are
inclusive.
.SH EXAMPLES
.IP
Readout \fB\-\-run\fR=\fI123\fR | daqtee \fB\-\-packet\fR=\fI101\fR myfilter | segmenter
.IP
Output all records read on stdin to stdout and write
a copy of records that have a packet type of 101 to
myfilter.
.IP
Readout \fB\-\-run\fR=\fI890\fR | daqtee \fB\-\-packet\fR=\fIPktDoc\fR recorddump | segmenter
.IP
Output all records read on stdin to stdout and write
a copy of records that have a packet type of PktDoc to
recorddump.
