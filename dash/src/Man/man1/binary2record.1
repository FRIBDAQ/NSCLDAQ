.SH NAME
binary2record \- manual page for binary2record 1.82
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B binary2record
\fI--run=INTEGER --packet=INTEGER \fR[\fIOPTION\fR]...
.SH DESCRIPTION
Convert binary data directly into DSH records.  This program is
not intended as an injection program, but as a primary source that
can consume binary data from stdin and write DSH records on stdout.
Data read from stdin is automagically packaged into well structured
records prior to being written to stdout.  The essential
characteristics of binary2record are as follows:
.PP
1.  Binary2record first emits a BEGINRUN record on stdout.
.PP
2.  Data read from stdin is expected to have a structure
.IP
that includes a leading byte count, indicating the number of data
bytes produced, followed by the data.  The leading byte count
should be a 4 byte integer in host byte order.
.PP
3.  Data read from stdin is automagically packaged into
.IP
records and written to binary2record's stdout.
.PP
4.  If binary2record's stdin is closed, or binary2record receives a
.IP
SIGINT, binary2record will emit a ENDRUN record on stdout and
then exit.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-\-version\fR
Output version information and exit
.TP
\fB\-\-help\fR
Display this help and exit
.TP
\fB\-\-debug\fR=\fISECONDS\fR
Output a debugging command and wait SECONDS
before beginning execution of main loop
.TP
\fB\-\-run\fR=\fIINTEGER\fR
Mandatory. Specify experiment run number
.TP
\fB\-\-title\fR=\fISTRING\fR
Experiment title string
.TP
\fB\-\-packet\fR=\fI[PACKET\fR|typed] Mandatory. Record type to use for records produced.
PACKET may be an integer or the symbolic name for
a well known packet type such as Physics.  If the
argument is the string "typed," then the binary records
read are assumed to have an host\-byte\-order integer
field, indicating the record type, following the length.
.SH EXAMPLES
.IP
binary2record \fB\-\-run\fR=\fI45\fR \fB\-\-packet\fR=\fI104\fR \fB\-\-title=\fR"Experiment number 45"
.IP
Produce records using run number 45 and title
"Experiment number 45."  Records produced from binary
data read from stdin will have a record type of 104.
