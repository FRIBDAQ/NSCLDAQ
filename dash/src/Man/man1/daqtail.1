.SH NAME
daqtail \- manual page for daqtail 1.82
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B daqtail
[\fIOPTION\fR]... \fIDIRECTORY\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
Output the records from a DAQ experiment that has previously been
saved to disk.  DAQ experimental data is stored in segmented
files to avoid exceeding the maximum file size of the filesystem.
To simplify processing experimental data, daqtail understands how
to output the records for the current experiment as the are
appended to the current segment.
.PP
Creation of new runs and new run segments in the specified directory
is understood by daqtail.  When new runs are added to the directory,
daqtail will detect that a new run has been stared and automatically
resume processing with this new run.  When new segments are created
for the current run, daqtail will detect that a new segment has been
created and continue processing with this new segment.
.PP
Unless the \fB\-\-catchup\fR option has been specified, processing begins
by outputting the last record of the most recent segment.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-\-version\fR
Output version information and exit
.TP
\fB\-\-help\fR
Display this help and exit
.TP
\fB\-\-debug\fR=\fISECONDS\fR
Output a debugging command and wait SECONDS
before beginning execution of main loop
.TP
\fB\-\-catchup\fR
Start processing with the first record
of the first segment of the current run.
.TP
\fB\-\-collate\fR=\fI[ctime\fR|runnumber] (default: ctime)
Collate the event files found in DIRECTORY
according to either file ctime (inode change time)
or by runnumber.
.TP
\fB\-\-file\fR
Treat DIRECTORY as a file.  The file specified will
be tailed until an ENDRUN, BADEND or CONTINUE
record is encountered.  Note that \fB\-\-collate\fR
has no effect when tailing a specific file.   If
\fB\-\-catchup\fR is specified, processing begins at the
start, instead of the end, of the specified file.
.SH EXAMPLES
.IP
daqtail /evt/data/output
