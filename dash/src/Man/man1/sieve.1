.SH NAME
sieve \- manual page for sieve 1.82
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B sieve
\fI--packet=PACKETS \fR[\fI--packet=PACKETS\fR]... [\fIOPTION\fR]...
.SH DESCRIPTION
Output only those records from a DAQ experiment that have the
specified packet types.  That is, only those records that have
packet types corresponding with those specified using the
\fB\-\-packet\fR flag will be written to standard out.  Records with type
BEGINRUN, ENDRUN, BADEND or CONTINUE are also written to standard
out to enable proper data stream parsing by consumers.
All other records, are dropped.
.PP
Packet types can be specified as either a single positive integer,
a range of positive integers or by using one of the known symbolic
names for some well known packet types.  Currently, the list
of symbolic well known packet types includes: Physics (a.k.a, Data),
Scaler, SnapSc, StateVar, RunVar, PktDoc and ParamDescript.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-\-version\fR
Output version information and exit
.TP
\fB\-\-help\fR
Display this help and exit
.TP
\fB\-\-debug\fR=\fISECONDS\fR
Output a debugging command and wait SECONDS
before beginning execution of main loop
.TP
\fB\-\-packet\fR=\fIPACKETS\fR
Mandatory.  If more than one occurrence of this
flag appears on the command line, all packets and
ranges specified will be considered.  PACKETS can
be either a single positive integer, a range of
positive integers (e.g., 101\-118 or 101,118) or
a symbolic name (e.g., Physics).  All ranges are
inclusive.
.TP
\fB\-\-invert\fR
Invert the sense of record type matching.  That
is, rather than including only those record types
specified, only exclude those record types specified.
.SH EXAMPLES
.IP
Readout \fB\-\-run\fR=\fI123\fR | sieve \fB\-\-packet\fR=\fI101\fR
.IP
Output only those records that have packet type 101 to
standard output.
.IP
Readout \fB\-\-run\fR=\fI890\fR | sieve \fB\-\-packet\fR=\fI105\-116\fR | recorddump
.IP
Pipe those records that have have a packet type falling in
the range from 105 to 116 (inclusive) into the program
recorddump.
.IP
Readout \fB\-\-run\fR=\fI567\fR | sieve \fB\-\-packet\fR=\fIPhysics\fR \fB\-\-packet\fR=\fI150\fR | recorddump
.IP
Pipe those records that have have a packet type corresponding
to the symbolic type of Physics and those records
with packet type 150 into the program recorddump.
