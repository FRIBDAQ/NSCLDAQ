.SH NAME
sample \- manual page for sample 1.82
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B sample
\fI--packet=PACKETS \fR[\fI--packet=PACKETS\fR]... [\fIOPTION\fR]...
.SH DESCRIPTION
Selectively sample records from a DAQ experiment that have the
packet types specified using the \fB\-\-packet\fR flag.
That is, sample considers each record read from standard input.
If the record's packet type matches one of the specified
packet types, then the record will only be written to standard
output if writing to standard output will not block.  All
other record types are unconditionally written to standard
output even if the write required to do so would block.
.PP
Packet types can be specified as either a single positive integer,
a range of positive integers or by using one of the known symbolic
names for some well known packet types.  Currently, the list
of symbolic well known packet types includes: Physics (a.k.a, Data),
Scaler, SnapSc, StateVar, RunVar, PktDoc and ParamDescript.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-\-version\fR
Output version information and exit
.TP
\fB\-\-help\fR
Display this help and exit
.TP
\fB\-\-debug\fR=\fISECONDS\fR
Output a debugging command and wait SECONDS
before beginning execution of main loop
.TP
\fB\-\-packet\fR=\fIPACKETS\fR
Mandatory.  If more than one occurrence of this
flag appears on the command line, all packets and
ranges specified will be considered.  PACKETS can
be either a single positive integer, a range of
positive integers (e.g., 101\-118 or 101,118) or
a symbolic name (e.g., Physics).  All ranges are
inclusive.
.SH EXAMPLES
.IP
Readout \fB\-\-run\fR=\fI123\fR | sample \fB\-\-packet\fR=\fI101\fR
.IP
Output those records that have packet type 101 only if
writing to standard output will not block.  All other
records are written regardless of blocking.
.IP
Readout \fB\-\-run\fR=\fI890\fR | sample \fB\-\-packet\fR=\fI105\-116\fR | recorddump
.IP
Pipe those records that have have a packet type falling in
the range from 105 to 116 (inclusive) into the program
recorddump only if writing to standard output will not
block.  All other records are written regardless of
blocking.
.IP
Readout \fB\-\-run\fR=\fI567\fR | sample \fB\-\-packet\fR=\fIPhysics\fR \fB\-\-packet\fR=\fI150\fR | recorddump
.IP
Pipe those records that have have a packet type corresponding
to the symbolic type of Physics and those records
with packet type 150 into the program recorddump only if
writing to standard output will not block.  All other records
are written regardless of blocking.
