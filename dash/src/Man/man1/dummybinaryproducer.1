.SH NAME
dummybinaryproducer \- manual page for dummybinaryproducer 1.82
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B dummybinaryproducer
[\fIOPTION\fR]...
.SH DESCRIPTION
Output random sized records from a dummy binary records for consumption
by a DAQ on\-ramp. This program produces records with a leading length
field, written as an integer in host byte order, followed by data bytes.
The length of the data is indicated by the leading length field; the size
of the length field is not included in the data length.  This program
is intended as a binary on\-ramp test program.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-\-version\fR
Output version information and exit
.TP
\fB\-\-help\fR
Display this help and exit
.TP
\fB\-\-debug\fR=\fISECONDS\fR
Output a debugging command and wait SECONDS
before beginning execution of main loop
.TP
\fB\-\-size\fR=\fIINTEGER\fR
Specify a fixed record size.  The default
is to generate random sized records up to a
maximum of 64K.
.TP
\fB\-\-iterations\fR=\fIINTEGER\fR Specify the number of data records this
producer should emit prior to exiting.
.HP
\fB\-\-delay\fR=\fIMICROSECONDS\fR Output occurs at a delay rate of MICROSECONDS
.TP
\fB\-\-packet\fR=\fIPACKET\fR
If this parameter is specified, then the binary record
records emitted are typed binary records.  That is
the emitted records will have an host\-byte\-order integer
field, indicating the record type, following the length.
This field will be set to PACKET.  PACKET may be an
integer or the symbolic name for a well known packet
type such as Physics.
.SH EXAMPLES
.IP
dummyproducer \fB\-\-run\fR=\fI45\fR | binaryonramp \fB\-\-packet\fR=\fI104\fR dummybinaryproducer |
.IP
segmenter /evt/data/output
.IP
Inject output from dummybinaryoneramp into the data stream.
Records produced from data from dummybinaryproducer will have a type
of 104.  If dummybinaryproducer terminates, it will not be restarted.
.IP
dummyproducer \fB\-\-run\fR=\fI46\fR | binaryonramp \fB\-\-packet\fR=\fI103\fR \fB\-\-restart\fR
.IP
dummybinaryproducer \fB\-\-iterations\fR=\fI10\fR | segmenter /evt/data/output
.IP
Inject output from dummybinaryproducer into the data stream.
Records produced from data produced by dummybinaryproducer will
have a type of 103.  Dummybinaryproducer will emit 10 records each
time it is executed and then exit.  When dummybinaryproducer
terminates, it is restarted by binaryonramp.
