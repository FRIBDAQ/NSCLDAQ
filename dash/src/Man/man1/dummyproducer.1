.SH SYNOPSIS
.B dummyproducer
\fI--run=INTEGER \fR[\fIOPTION\fR]...
.SH DESCRIPTION
Output random sized records from a dummy DAQ experiment.  Each
execution of dummyproducer begins with a BEGINRUN record and
ends with either an ENDRUN or BADEND record depending on how
the producer was terminated.  If dummyproducer is terminated
with a SIGINT (Ctrl\-C), then dummyproducer emits an
ENDRUN record.  If dummyproducer is terminated by a SIGTERM,
then dummyproducer will emit a BADEND record prior to exiting.
All other records are of type PHYSICS.
