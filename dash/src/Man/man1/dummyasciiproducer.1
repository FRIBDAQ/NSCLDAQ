.SH NAME
dummyasciiproducer \- manual page for dummyasciiproducer 1.82
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B dummyasciiproducer
[\fIOPTION\fR]...
.SH DESCRIPTION
Output random sized records from a dummy ASCII records for consumption
by a DAQ ASCII on\-ramp.  This program produces printable ASCII
records separated by a separator character.  This program is intended
as an ASCII on\-ramp test program.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-\-version\fR
Output version information and exit
.TP
\fB\-\-help\fR
Display this help and exit
.TP
\fB\-\-debug\fR=\fISECONDS\fR
Output a debugging command and wait SECONDS
before beginning execution of main loop
.TP
\fB\-\-size\fR=\fIINTEGER\fR
Specify a fixed record size.  The default
is to generate random sized records up to a
maximum of 64K.
.TP
\fB\-\-iterations\fR=\fIINTEGER\fR Specify the number of data records this
producer should emit prior to exiting.
.HP
\fB\-\-delay\fR=\fIMICROSECONDS\fR Output occurs at a delay rate of MICROSECONDS
.TP
\fB\-\-separator\fR=\fICHARCTER\fR Specify that CHARCTER should be used as the
separator character.  Default is a new line

.IP
segmenter /evt/data/output
.IP
Inject output from dummybinaryoneramp into the data stream.
Records produced from data from dummyasciiproducer will have a type
of 104.  If dummyasciiproducer terminates, it will not be restarted.

segmenter /evt/data/output
.IP
Inject output from dummyasciiproducer into the data stream.
Records produced from data produced by dummyasciiproducer will
have a type of 103.  Dummybinaryproducer will emit 10 records each
time it is executed and then exit.  A formfeed character will
be used as the separator character.  When dummyasciiproducer
terminates, it is restarted by asciionramp.
