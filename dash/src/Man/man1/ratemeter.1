[\fI--consume\fR] [\fI--every=INTEGER\fR]... [\fIOPTION\fR]...

\fB\-\-debug\fR=\fISECONDS\fR
Output a debugging command and wait SECONDS
before beginning execution of main loop
.TP
\fB\-\-every\fR=\fIINTEGER\fR
An attempt will be made to output statistics to
standard error every INTEGER seconds of wall clock
time.  That is, statistics will output after the
specified number of seconds have passed and a
new record has been read.  Default is 10 seconds.
.TP
\fB\-\-consume\fR
Records will be consumed rather written to
standard out.
.SH EXAMPLES
.IP
Readout \fB\-\-run\fR=\fI123\fR | ratemeter \fB\-\-every\fR=\fI10\fR | recorddump
.IP
Calculate statistics for run 123, outputting statistics
on standard error every 10 seconds.  Records
are then written to standard output for consumption by
recorddump.
.IP
Readout \fB\-\-run\fR=\fI890\fR | ratemeter \fB\-\-consume\fR \fB\-\-every\fR=\fI5\fR
.IP
Calculate statistics for run 890, outputting statistics
on standard error every 5 seconds.  Records
