# @brief  NSCLDAQ user software boot program.
# @author Ron Fox <fox@nscl.msu.edu>

##
# This script boots up the user's software for an experiment.
# It does this in response to state transition requests to the Ready state
# from the experiment state manager.
# It also shuts down the user's software in the event of a transition to the
# not ready state.
#
#  The elements started include:
#  *  Creation of ring buffers associated with the experiment.
#  *  Programs associated with the experiment.
#
#  The elements shut down include:
#  *  Programs associated with the experiment
#  *  Deletion of ring buffers associated with the experiment
#
#  Experiment definition databases are used to deterime what is part of the
#  experiment (see Usage below).
#
#
# Usage:
#   boot --host server-hostname --state-service state-publication-service-name \
#         experiment-database [...]
#
# Where:
#   --host  Specifies the host on which the state manager runs.  If not
#           supplied, this defaults to 'localhost'
#   --state-service Specifies the service name of the state publication port
#           if not specified, this defaults to 'StatePublish'
#   --transition-service - Specifies the service name of the state transition
#           port.  If not specified, defaults to 'StateRequest'.
#
#  experiment-database - are the paths to one or more experiment databases
#           whose contents will determine the make up of the experiment.
#           at start, elements of the experiment are taken from each database
#           in command line order.  At stop time this order is reversed.
#           Thus, for example, you could specify an experiment that couples
#           detectors together as three databases, one for each detector system's
#           daq and one for whatever elements are needed to couple the systems.
#          e.g. boot $S800SW/s800.db $CAESARSW/ceasar ~/config/s800-ceasar-coupling
#           
# Note:
#   Short options are also defined:  -n for --host -s for --state-service
#   Additional switches are defined that don't actually run the program:
#   -h, --help  - Outputs some Usage help text for the program to stdout and
#                 exits.
#   -v, --version - Outputs the program version to stdout and exits.
#
# Note:
#    The defaults for --host, --state-service, --transition-service are correct
#    for a statemanger started with defaults in the same host as the boot host.
