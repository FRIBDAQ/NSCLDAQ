# @class StateMonitorBase
#
#   Simplest possible state manager base class.  Initial state publication is
#   via call to the overridable initialState method and transitions to the
#   overridable Transition method.
#
#  An initializer callout allows additional poll targets to be registered.
#
#   We also provide ways to make a request of the state manager server.
