      	                Version v2p3pA Release notes
		   Model 1003 PCI Adaptor Support Software

    Version v2p3pA:
	
			Add Kbuild support for kernel 2.6.6 (added install/remove scripts)
            Note bigphysarea kernel patch is not yet ported to 2.6.X

    Version v2p3p0:

          Added support for VME dataBlizzard models 800, 800-202, 810,
          820, and 830, which are PCI to VME 64 based adapters.

    Beta version v2p2pC:
            Add code to support 2.6.1 kernels
            Note bigphysarea kernel patch is not yet ported to 2.6.1

    Beta version v2p2pB:
            Add code to support 2.4.20-6 kernels (Red Hat 9)
            Modify dd/bt_param.c to enable/disable bigphysarea support via 
            compiler switch

    Beta version v2p2pA:
            Add code to return +/- 256 byte residual (if 256 byte aligned + 
            count) rather than the existing +/- 64k byte residual transfer 
            count for read requests.

    Version v2.2:
            Add bt_bind and bt_unbind support.

            Add A64 support.

            Tested with Red Hat 8.0 Linux 2.4.18

    Beta version v2.1.E:
            Fixed bug with multiprocess DMA and opens of system hang.

    Beta version v2.1.D:
            Fixed bug with local and remote dual port RAM on dataBLIZZARD.

            Internal diagnostic routines now work.

    Beta version v2.1.C:
            Restored double buffering since problem with 2.4.18-x kernels.

            Restored disabled Polled mode DMAs.

            Fixed kernel panic when bt_kvm2bus() failed.

            Requires DMA_POLL_CEILING to be set higher then 0x20000 for 
            stressor to not hang.

            Fixed bug where all DMA was done D32 not D64.
            
    Beta version v2.1.B:
            Added hardware diagnostic routines for GEMS only.

            Elimates the kernel double buffering for DMAs

            Added driver version and hardware firmware revision.

            Prevents PIO/DMA from occuring at same time to fix system
            lockups

            Breaks DMAs up to 0x20000 or less xfers to prevent timeout on 
            MCP750 single board computers.

    Beta version v2.1.a:
            Adds "CC = kgcc" to sys/makefile for newer Red Hat GNU/Linux
            releases; if kgcc doesn't exist, simply delete that line.

            Fixes page usage count in bt_vmnopage() for 2.4.x kernels.
            This error caused hangs or panics when using bt_icbr multiple
            times, after it did an mmap() to the BT_DEV_DIAG minor device.

            Improved the btp_open() and btp_close() entry point functions.


    Official version v2.0:
	    Obsoletes the following beta releases: v1.1.a, v1.1.b and v1.1.c.
            (There was no v1.1 release; Official releases are just v1.0 & v2.0.)

            Adds support for 2.4.x Linux kernels.

            Supports Red Hat GNU/Linux 7.2 (kernel 2.4.7-10), Red Hat GNU/Linux
            7.0 (kernel 2.2.16-22) and Red Hat GNU/Linux 6.0 (kernel 2.2.5-15)
            on the x86 platform.  It has also been tested on SuSE GNU/Linux 7.3
            (kernel 2.4.10-4GB), Red Hat GNU/Linux 6.1 (kernel 2.2.12-20) and
            SuSE GNU/Linux 6.2 (kernel 2.2.10).  It should work with any 2.2.x
            or 2.4.x kernel.


    Official version v1.0:
	    Obsoletes the following beta releases: v1.0.a, v1.0.b, v1.0.c,
	    v1.0.d and v1.0.e.

            Supports Red Hat 7.0 Linux (kernel 2.2.16-22) and Red Hat 6.0
	    Linux (kernel 2.2.5-15) on the x86 platform.  It has also been
            tested on Red Hat 6.1 (kernel 2.2.12-20) and SuSE 6.2 Linux
            (kernel 2.2.10).  It should work with any 2.2.x kernel.

            Supports all SBS (PCI, cPCI) to (PCI, cPCI, VME) adapter sets
            including 616, 617, 618, 620, 628, 630, 712, 713, 722, 723,
            732, & 733 plus SBS dataBLIZZARD adapter sets DB0-PCI-PCI,
            DB0-CPCI-CPCI, DB0-PMC-PMC, DB0-PCI-CPCI, DB0-PCI-PMC &
            DB0-CPCI-PMC.

	    The driver file dd/btp_kernel.c routines have not been tested.
            These routines allow other kernel drivers to install a kernel
            interrupt service routine that the SBS driver will call
            whenever a given interrupt type occurs.  These routines are
            the means by which RORA VMEbus devices can be supported.
            Thus v1.0 only supports interrupts from ROAK VMEbus devices.


    Beta version v1.0.e:
	    All known bugs fixed, excluding dd/btp_kernel.c which hasn't
            been tested as mentioned above.  Supports Red Hat 6.0
            (kernel 2.2.5-15).  Also supports SBS dataBLIZZARD adapters.


    Beta version v1.0.b:
            Fixed a bug were adaptor writes were doing reads.         


    Beta version v1.0.a:
            Initialial beta version for Red Hat 6.0 Linux and up.
            This device driver supports Bit 3 Model 616, 617, 618
            Adaptors.
