        <h1>Filter->Filter...</h1>
        <p>
            The <b>Filter->Filter...</b> command supports the establishment of
            <a href="filters.html">buffer filters</a>.  Buffer filters in
            conjunction with <a href="search.html">search patterns</a> provide
            powerful tools to selectively examine data buffer contents.
        </p>
        <p>
            When you select the <b>Filter->Filter...</b> command the filter
            creation dialog shown below is displayed:<br />
            <img src="filter.gif">
            <br/>
            This dialog is divided into three panes:
            <ol>
                <li>The top pane allows you to enable filtering by buffer
                    type and select which buffer types will be accepted.
                    You must enable this pane by selecting the <em>Enable
                    Buffer Filtering</em> checkbutton.
                    <ol>
                        <li>Select the buffer types
                            you wish to accept in the left list box and click the
                            right arrow button to transfer them to the right listbox.
                        </li>
                        <li>If there are buffers type in the right listbox you no longer
                            wish to accept, select them and click the left arrow button to
                            return them to the left listbox.
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>The second frame allows you to specify bit pattern matches within the buffer
                    if no bit patterns are specified, all buffers accepted match.  Describing
                    bit pattern matches is done in a manner simlilar to specifying
                    bit patterns for <a href="filtersearch.html">searches</a>:
                    <ol>
                        <li>The row of 'x's at the left of this part of the dialog
                            represent the 16 bits of a binary word.  Use the up and down arrow keys
                            to select the desired state for each bit or leave a bit at 'x' if you
                            don't care about its state.</li>
                        <li>Once you have edited a bit pattern, add it to the pattern list by
                            clicking the right arrow button just to the right of the bit pattern.</li>
                        <li>You can remove a bit pattern you no longer want from the list by
                            selecting it and clicking the Remove button at the right of the list.</li>
                        <li>You can re-order a bit pattern upwards or downwards by selecting it
                            and clicking either the up or down arrow buttons to the right of the
                            list.  Note that order is only important for bit sequence matches</li>
                        <li>Select the <em>Any</em> radio button to specify a match on
                            any of the patterns in the box.  Select the <em>Sequence</em>
                            radio button to specify a match on the ordered sequence of bit
                            patterns specified in the list box.
                        </li>
                    </ol> </li>
                <li>The bottom frame of the dialog provides 3 buttons:
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Ok</b> When clicked accepts the filter for application
                            when getting the next buffer from the data source</li>
                        <li><b>Clear</b> clears the filter so that if accepted with <b>Ok</b>
                            all buffers will be accepted.</li>
                        <li><b>Cancel</b> dismisses the dialog box without making any changes
                            to the filter criterion.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ol>
        </p>
        <p>
            If a bit pattern search is specified, once a matching buffer is found, the first
            occurance of the bit pattern is located an highlighted as if a search for it had
            been performed.
