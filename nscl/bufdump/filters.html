        <h1>An Introduction to Filters</h1>
        <p>
            Filters are mechanism to select a subset of buffers for
            display by bufdump.  Filters and <a href="search.html">searches</a>
            provide a powerful mechanism for looking for specific data within
            event buffers.
        </p>
        <p>
            Filters operate on two levels:
            <ul>
                <li><em>Buffer type filters</em>specify that you are only
                    interested in seeing specific subsets of buffer types</li>
                <li><em>Bit pattern filters</em>specify that you are only interested
                    in seeing buffers that have specific bit patterns or sequences
                    of bit patterns in their bodies.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>Filters are established with the <a href="filterfilter.html">Filter->Filter...</a>
            command.  If a filter has been defined, everytime you request the next buffer
            from a data source, bufdump will read and ignore buffers until the filter
            criterion is met. Note that at this time, there is no way to abort the
            <em>next buffer</em> operation.  Therefore if you create filter criteria that are
            never met, bufdump will hang and need to be restarted.  Later implementations of
            bufdump may lift this restriction.
