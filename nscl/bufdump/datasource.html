        <h1>Data Sources</h1>
        <p>
            A data source is a source of data in buffers that are formatted
            by the NSCL data acquisition system or some compatible software
            or hardware.  Data sources provide the data that bufdump formats
            for you.
        </p>
        <p>
            See the <a href="fileopen.html">File->Open</a> menu command
            documentation for a description of how to open a data source.
        </p>
        <p>
            At the time this documentation is being written, the bufdump
            program supports the following data sources:
            <ul>
                <li>Event Files.  These are event files that have been
                    saved to disk and are available in the filesystem
                    of the computer running the program.  Event files
                    may be on mounted shares or purely local.</li>
                <li>Online data.  This represents a direct connection to
                    a data source on a system running the NSCL data
                    acquisition system.  In order to acquire data
                    from an online data source, the NSCL data acquisition
                    software must be installed and running on the computer
                    running bufdump as well.   This software makes some
                    assumptions about where this software is installed.
                    At present, the NSCL DAQ software is assumed to be
                    installed in /usr/opt/daq/current, or assumes that
                    /usr/opt/daq/current represents a link to the actual
                    top level directory of the NSCL DAQ installation.

            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            If the location of the NSCL Data acquisition software does not
            match your installation, talk with your system manager about either
            establishing the link described above or alternatively, modifying
            bufdump.tcl.  Locate the line that reads:
            <pre>
if {[catch {theEvents openOnline $host -buffersize $buffersize} msg] == 0} {
            </pre>
            And modify it to read:
            <pre>
if {[catch {theEvents openOnline $host -daqroot yourroot -buffersize $buffersize} msg] == 0} {
            </pre>
           Where <em>yourroot</em> is the root of your installation.
        </p>
