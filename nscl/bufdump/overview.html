        <h1>Overview of bufdump </h1>
        <p>
            bufdump is a Tcl/Tk script that understands the structure
            of data buffers produced by the NSCL Data Acquisition System (NSCLDAQ).
            In addition to understanding the outer structure of data buffers, bufdump
            understands how to produce understandable dumps of the internal structure
            of each buffer.  This understanding extends to a knowledge of the known registered
            packet types, as well as the ability to be taught about new packet types and
            how to support them.
