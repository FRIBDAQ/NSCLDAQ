        <p>
            Searches are a mechanism bufdump provides for locating specific
            data within buffers that are already displayed.  The bufdump
            search facility allows you to search for:
            <ul>
                <li>Specific ASCII strings in the dumped data</li>
                <li>Specific regular expressions in the dumped data.
                    The syntax of regular expressions is powerful, complex
                    and beyond the scope of this document.  For information
                    about regular expressions, see the regex(7) man page on
                    the Linux systems, or read the sections describing the
                    regexp command in Tcl books.</li>
                <li>Specific bit patterns in the dumped data.  A bit pattern
                    can have "don't care" bits as well as specified bits.</li>
                <li>Sequences of bit patterns in the dumped data.  Each bit pattern
                    in the sequence can have "don't care" bits as well as specified bits</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>Searches are specified via the <a href="filtersearch.html">Filter->Search...</a>
            command.  Once a search has been specified, it can be repeated without
            respecification via the <a href="filtersearchnext.html">Filter->Search Next</a>
            command.
